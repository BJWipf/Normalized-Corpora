THE PREFACE.
INGENUOUS READER;
THou hast here presented to thee a sad Emblem of the strange sleights and cunning subtleties, whereby Satan la∣bours daily to ensnare souls, and at last to bring them to utter ruin; who being that grand impostor, soon began this work, even in the morning of the Creation, in the body of a Serpent miraculously, to reason, dispute, speak, and confer with Eve; and never ceased till he had laid the honour of those glorious creatures in the dust: and therefore is called that old Serpent, that decay∣veth all the world, by whose deceitful promises and subtle devices (for his own end, and desire of their destruction,) hath ensnared and drawn these poor silly creatures, into these horrid and detestable practises, of renouncing God and Christ, and entering into a solemn league and contract with the Devil [a]; the thought whereof is sufficient to cause a man to be filled with horror and astonishment. The Law and ex∣press command of God doth allow of no familiarity or in∣quiry of any other spirit, but from himself; as Isa. 8.19. And when they shall say unto you, seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto Wizards, that peep and that mutter, should not a people seek unto their God, &c. Under this interrogative is understood this af∣firmative,

A people should inquire of no other spirit, but of their God only. By which also it is evident, that all spirits that doe suffer themselves to be inquired at, are evil spirits, and therefore [b] Devils. And though these devilish pra∣ctises were frequent and common amongst heathens and in∣fidells, who usually held familiarity with these spirits, and many inquired of them in their Oracles; and therefore cal∣led those spirits that gave answer by them, Daemons [c] of their skill and knowledge in foretelling things to come: yet now when the light of the Gospel shines so gloriously, that such a generation of poor deluded souls (and to such a number∣ber as hath of late been discovered) should be found amongst us, is much more matter of admiration and astonishment [d]. I doubt not but these things may seem as incredible unto some, as they are matter of admiration unto others. Nolle nimis sapere, saith the Poet, It is true wisdom not to be too wise; that is, not to know nor desire to know more then is al∣lowed or needful; needful not in our desires, but in Gods decree: Here then let reasonable men be persuaded not too much (as is usual) to swell with indignation, or to be puf∣fed with impatience, where God doth not overtly reveal and plainly (as they desire and think needful) the subtle Engines and mystical craft of the Devil in the machine∣tions of Witches and Sorcerers; but soberly, modestly, and discreetly, so far forth-be contented to pursue the trial and just way of their discovery, as with sense, with reason, with Religion, is just and righteous; knowing, that what∣soever is beyond these lists, is reasonless, senseless and imp∣os. The greatest doubt and question will be, whether it be in the power of the Devil to perform such asportation and local translation of the bodies of Witches; it seems in reason a thing whereunto the Devil is unable: And when∣there these supernatural works, which are above the power of


man to do, and proper only to Spirits, whether they are real, or only imaginary and fained. In answer to which, it is ve∣rye probable that the Devil hath power to dispose and trance∣port the bodies of men and women, where God himself doth not countermand or prohibit: as instance, when he took the body of our Saviour and set it upon a pinnacle of the Temple; and these supernatural acts may appear to the outward sense, as Histories; and many other true reports and Records of other wonderful works and supernatural feats, all alike of∣feared to the outward sense. It is true, that a Spirit, and a spiritual work simply in it self, in the own nature and substance cannot be seen by any bodily eye, or be deprehended by any outward sense, notwithstanding, as they do mix them∣selves with bodily substances, are certainly tried and subject to the sense: For illustration hereof, instance may be given in holy Scripture, as the Sorcerers of Egypt, where water was turned into blood, the rod into a Serpent, &c. By a spy∣ritual power their eyes did manisestly see the water, and as apparently after see the blood, and the rod turned into a Serpent, the eye being a true and undeceived witness of both: Things imagined and fancied, are easily discerned from those things that are real and true objects. But it may be demanded, whether a Spirit or Devil can cause such a transmutation of the bodies of Witches into those several shapes and forms of Cats, Dogs, Birds, and other creatures, as is often reported, where Witches and Sorcerers have lived. The answer is, that it is impose∣sible in nature, and in the ordinary unchangeable course of all things created by God, that one individual and conti∣nued substance or entire thing should be wholly divided from it self, and yet be it self; [e] for there can be no real or true transmutation of one substance, or nature into another, but either by creation or generation. Now creation is the


work of in infinite power, and therefore of God alone. The Devil then cannot create, neither can he do it by any course of true generation, [f] because a true and real generation hath many precedent alterations, and by little and little, in space of time [g] grows unto the perjection of that kind unto which it doth tend, or is begotten; therefore they are but seeming and juggling transmutations of the Devil: And here that saying of Augustine may be alleged, De civit. Dei, lib. 18. cap. 18. (Nec sane Daemones natu∣ras creant, sed specie tenus, quae à Deo creata sunt commutant, ut videantur esse quae non sunt) that is, Devils cannot create any nature or substance, but in jug∣gling show, or seemingly only, whereby with false shadows covering those things which are created of God to cause them to seem that which they are not indeed. Take one in∣stance of the juggling and illusions of the Devil above all the rest, which doth most palpably detect him herein, is a History related by Johannes Baptist Port, in his se∣cond book, de Magia natural; he there witnesses, that upon the Devils suggestion, a Witch believed firmly and persuaded her self, that all the night she had rid in the air, over divers great mountains, and met in convene∣ticles with other Witches, when the same night, the men∣tioned Author himself, with others that watched her and saw her all that imagined time of her transvection in the air, to be within her chamber profoundly sleeping; yea, had smitten her, made her flesh blew with strokes, and could not awake her, nor persuade her afterword when she was awa∣ked that they had so used her, or at all had seen or be∣held her; thus prevalent was the juggling power of the Devil.
Many other like instances of like nature might be added, only what here is published and communicated unto the

world, may sufficiently discover those strong delusions which these poor souls were given up unto, who now according to their demerits, and according to the Laws of God and this kingdom established, have received their just reward.

And Sir Thomas Bows, Knight, another of his Majesties Justices of Peace for this County, the 21th of March. 1645.
THis Informant saith, That about Christmas last, his wife was taken sick, and lame, with such violent fits, that this Informant verily conceived her sickness was some∣thing more then merely natural: Where∣upon this Informant about a fortnight since went to a Cunning Woman, the wife of one Hovye at Hadleigh in Suffolk, who told this Informant, that his wife was cursed by two women who were near neighbours to this Informant, the one dwelling a little above his house, and the other beneath his house, this Informants house standing on the side of an Hill: Whereupon he believed his said wife was bewitched by one Elizabeth Clarke, alias Bedingfield, that dwelt above this Informants house, for that the said Eliza∣beths mother and some other of her kinsfolk did suffer death for Witchcraft and murder.


The Information of Matthew Honkins, of Mannintree, Gent. taken upon Oath before us the 25th day of March. 1645.
THis Informant saith, That the said Elizabeth Clarke (suspected for a Witch as aforesaid) being by the appointment of the said Justices watched certain nights, for the better discovery of her wicked Practises, this Informant came into the room where the said Elizabeth was watched; as aforesaid, the last night, being the 24th of this instant March, but intended not to have stayed long there. But the said Elizabeth forth with told this Informant and one Master Sterne there present, if they would stay and do the said Elizabeth no hurt, she would call one of her white Imps, and play with it in her lap; but this Informant told her, they would not allow of it; And that staying there a while longer, the said Elizabeth confessed she had had carnal copulation with the Devil six or seven years; and that he would appear to her three or four times in a week at her bed side, and go to bed to her, and lye with her half a night together in the shape of a proper Gen∣tleman, with a laced band, having the whole proportion of a man, and would say to her, Bess Imust lye with you, and she did never deny him: And within a quarter of an hour after there appeared an Imp like to a Dog, which was white, with some sandy spots, and seemed to be very fat and plump; with very short legs, who forthwith vanished away: And the said Elizabeth said the name of that Imp was, Jarmara: And immediately there appeared ano∣there Imp, which she called Vinegar Tom, in the shape of a Grey∣hound with long legs: And the said Elizabeth then said that the next Imp should be a black Imp, and should come for the said Master Sterne, which appeared, but presently vanished: And the last that appeared was in the shape of a Polecat, but the head some∣what bigger. And the said Elizabeth then told this Informant that she had five Imps of her own, and two of the Imps of the old Beldam West (meaning one Anne West, widow) who is now al∣so suspected to be guilty of Witchcraft: And said sometimes the Imps of the old Beldam sucked on the said Elizabeth, and some∣times her Imps sucked on the old Beldam West. And the said Elizabeth further told this Informant, that Satan would never let

her rest, or be quiet, until she did consent to the killing of the Hogs of one Mr Edwards of Mannintree aforesaid, and the Horse of one Robert Tailor of the same Town: And this Informant fur∣there saith, That going from the House of the said Mr Edwards to his own House about nine or ten of the Clock that night, with his Greyhound with him, he saw the Greyhound suddenly give a jump, and ran as she had been in a full course after an Hare; And that when this Informant made haste to see what his Grey∣hound so eagerly pursued; He espied a white thing about the big∣ness of a Kitlyn, and the Greyhound standing aloose from it; and that by and by the said white Imp or Kitlyn danced about the said Greyhound, and by all likelihood bit off a piece of the flesh of the shoulder of the Greyhound; for the Greyhound came shrieking and crying to this Informant with a piece of flesh torn from her shoulder. And this Informant further saith, That com∣ming into his own Yard that night, he espied a black thing, pro∣portioned like a Cat, only it was thrice as big, sitting on a straw∣berry-bed, and fixing the eyes on this Informant; and when he went towards it, it leaped over the pale towards this Informant, as he thought, but ran quite through the Yard, with his Grey∣hound after it to a great Gate, which was underset with a pair of Tumbrel Strings, and did throw the said Gate wide open, and then vanished; And the said Greyhound returned again to this Informant, shaking and trembling exceedingly.

The Information of John Sterne, Gent. taken upon Oath before us the 25th day of March. 1645.
THis Informant saith, That watching with Elizabeth Clarke, (suspected for Witchcraft, as aforesaid) she confessed that the Devil had had carnal copulation with her in the likeness of a man; and that the said Elizabeth desired this Informant, and the rest that were in the room with her to sit down, and said, she would show this Informant and the rest some of her Imps: And within half an hour there appeared a white thing in the likeness of a Cat, but not altogether so big: And being asked if she would not be afraid of her Imps; the said Elizabeth answered; What

doe ye think I am afraid of my children? And that she called the name of that white Imp, Hoult. And this Informant further saith, That presently after there appeared another white Imp, with red spots, as big as a small dog, which she then called Jarmara: And that immediately after, there appeared at the threshold of the door another Imp about the bigness of the first, but did present∣lie vanish away. And then the said Elizabeth being asked if any more Imps would come; she answered, That Vinegar Tom would come by and by. And forthwith there appeared another in the like∣ness of a dumb Dog, somewhat bigger then any of the former: And the said Elizabeth also told this Informant, That she had three Imps from her mother, which were of a browne colour, and two from the old Beldam West: And that there had five Imps appeared; But she had one more called Sack and Sugar, which had been hard at work, and it would be long before it came, but it should tear this Informant. And a while after the said Elizabeth said, That it was well for this Informant he was so quick, otherwise the said Imp had soon skipped upon his face, and perchance had got into his throat, and then there would have been a feast of Toads in this Informants belly. And the said Elizabeth further confessed to this Informant, that she had one Imp for which she would fight up to the knees in blood, before she would lose it. And that her Imps did commonly suck on the old Beldam West; and that the said old Beldams Imps, did suck on her the said Elizabeth likewise.

And that the said Elizabeth told these Informants, That the old

Beldam (meaning the said Anne West) did by Witchcraft kill the wife of one Robert Oaks of Lawford in the County aforesaid; and was the death of a Clothiers child of Dedham in the said Coun∣tie of Essex: both which dyed as these Informants very well know about a week since. And the said Elizabeth told these Informants, that the said old Beldam West had the wife of one William Cole of Mannintree aforesaid in handling, who dyed not long since of a pining and languishing disease.

The Information of George Turner taken upon oath the 25th day of March. 1645. before the said Justices.
THis Informant saith, That going to the said Elizabeth Clarke, alias Bedingfeild, after she was apprehended, and asking her whether she had any hand in the drowning of one Thomas Turner, this Informants Brother, who was cast away at Sea about thirty months since; the said Elizabeth answered, That the old Bell∣dam West raised that wind that sunk his Hoy: And that she the said Elizabeth had no hand in that business.

THis Informant saith, That watching with the said Elizabeth Clarke, alias Bedingfeild, the last night, he asked the said Eliza∣beth if he should continue still in the room with her; And the said Elizabeth desired he should, if he would fight for her with the De∣vills, for they would come this night, and that which she called

Hoult would come first, and then that which she called Jarmara; which did appear in the likeness of a white Dog, with red spots; and presently after there appeared that Imp which she called Vinegar Tom; and then that which she called Sack and Su∣gar: And the said Elizabeth then told this Informant, that the Devil had had possession of her six or seven years. And that he had oftentimes knocked at her door in the night time; and that she did arise, open the door and let him in; and that he went to bed to her three or four times in a week, and had the carnal knowledge of her as a man.

The Examination of the said Elizabeth Clarke, alias Bedingfeild, taken before the said Justices the 25th of March. 1645.
THis Examinant saith, [8] That about six months since she met with the said Anne West, widow, (who is now likewise ap∣prehended) in a field near the house of the said Elizabeth, where the said Elizabeth was picking up a few sticks; The said Anne West seemed much to pity this Examinant for her lameness (ha∣ving but one leg) and her poverty; And said to this Examinant, That there was ways and means for her to live much better then now she did: And said, that she would send to this Examinant a thing like a little Kitlyn, which would fetch home some victu∣alls for this Examinant; and that it should doe her no hurt. And this Examinant saith, that within two or three nights after there came a white thing to her in the night, and the night after a gray one, which spake to this Examinant, and told her they would doe her no hurt, but would help her to an Husband, who should maintain her ever after: And that these two things came into this Examinants bed every night, or every other night, and sucked upon the lower parts of her body.

THis Informant saith, That about nine weeks since, Elizabeth, the wife of Edward Gooding (who is accused by the said Eliza∣beth Clarke to be a confederate with her) came to the Shop of this

Informant, and desired to be trusted for half a pound of Cheese, which being denied, she went away, muttering and mumbling to her self, and within a few hours came again with money, and bought a pound of Cheese of this Informant, and the same night this Informant having an Horse standing in his stable, the said Horse was taken in a strange manner sick and lame; whereupon this Informant sent for four Ferriers to have their best advice, who could not discover the cause of the disease; but the said Horse about four days after died: And this Informant also saith, that it was observed by himself, and divers others, who often went to see the said Horse, that still upon their coming into the stable, he lay quiet, and looked cheerfully, but as soon as the door was shut, and the Horse alone, he did violently beat himself, and that the belly of the said Horse would rumble and make a noise, as a foul chimney set on fire: And this Informant further saith, that he is induced to believe, that the said Elizabeth Gooding was the cause of the death of his said Horse; for that this Informant hath heard, that Elizabeth Clark, and Anne Leech widow, (who stand both accused for Witchcraft, and have confessed themselves guilty) have impeached the said Elizabeth Gooding for killing of this said Horse, and that the said Elizabeth Gooding is a lewd woman, and to this Informants knowledge, hath kept company with the said Eliza∣beth Clark, Anne Leech, and Anne West, which Anne West hath been suspected for a Witch many years since, and suffered impri∣sonment for the same.

The Examination of Elizabeth Gooding, taken before the said Justices the 11th. of April, 1645.
THis Examinant saith, [9] that she is not guilty of any one parti∣cular charged upon her in the Information of the said Robert Tailor.


The Information of Richard Edwards of Mannintree aforesaid, taken before the said Justices the 23. day of April, 1645.
THis Informant saith, That about twelve months since, upon a Sabbath day, after the afternoon Sermon, driving his

Cows home by the house of Anne Leech of Mislay widow, about forty yards from her said house, a black Cow of this Infor∣mints, (being very well to his thinking) fell down, and within two days after died. And the very next day driving his Cows from the same pasture, this Informant had a white Cow that fell down within a Rod of the same place, where the other Cow fell, (being also, as this Informant conceived, sound and well) and within a weak after dyed; and he further saith, that he caused both the said Cows to be opened, and that there could be no dis∣ease discovered, which might occasion their death: And this In∣formant likewise saith, that about August last, he had a child nursed by one Goodwife Wiles, dwelling near the houses of the said Elizabeth Clark and Elizabeth Gooding, and that his said child was taken sick, and had very strange fits, extending the limbs, and rolling the eyes, and within two days after dyed: And this Informant doth verily believe, that Anne Leech, and the said Eli∣zabeth Gooding, were the death of his said child, as is confessed by the said Anne Leech in her own Confession and Examination.

The Examination of Anne Leech of Mislay in the County aforesaid, widow, taken before the said Justices, April 14. 1645.
THis Examinant saith, [10] That she had a grey Impesent to her, and that this Examinant, together with the said Elizabeth Clark, and Elizabeth, the wife of Edward Gooding, did about a year since, send their Imps to kill a black Cow and a white Cow of Mr. Edwards, which was done accordingly: And this Examinant saith, that she sent her gray Imp, Elizabeth Clark a black Imp, and Eli∣beth Gooding a white Imp: And this Examinant saith, that about thirty years since, she sent a gray Imp to kill two Horses of one Mr. Brag of Mislay, which were killed accordingly; and that the occasion of her malice was, because Mistress Brag had told this Examinant, that she suspected her to be a naughty woman; and this Examinant confesses, that she and the said Eliz. Gooding, sent either of them an Imp to destroy the child of the said Mr. Edwards; this Examinants Imp being then a white one, and Eli∣zabeth Goodings a black Imp; and that about thirty years since,

this Examinant had the said white Imp, and two others, a gray, and a black Imp of one Anne, the wife of Robert Pearce of Stoic in Suffolk, being her brother; and that these Imps went com∣monly from one to another, and did mischief where ever they went; and that when this Examinant did not send and employ them abroad to do mischief, she had not her health, but when they were employed, she was healthful and well, and that these Imps did usually suck those teats which were found about the pri∣vie parts of her body; and that the said Imps did often speak to this Examinant, and told her, she should never feel hell torments, and that they spake to her in an hollow voice, which she plainly understood: And this Examinant also confess∣seth, that she sent her gray Imp to Elizabeth, the daughter of To∣bert Kirk of Mannyntree, about three years since, to destroy her; and upon the sending of the said Imp, the said Elizabeth languish∣ed by the space of one whole year, until she dyed, and that the occasion of offence this Examinant took against her the said Eli∣zabeth was, for that she had asked a Coif of the said Elizabeth, which she refused to give to this Examinant. And further, this Examinant saith, that long since, but the exact time she cannot remember, she sent her gray Imp to kill the daughter of the widow Rawlyns of Mislay aforesaid; and the reason was, because this Ex∣eminent was put out of her Farm, and the said widow Rawlyns put in, where she dwells at this present. And moreover, this Examinant confesses, that she was acquainted with the sending of an Imp by the aforesaid Elizabeth Gooding, to vex and torment Mary the wife of John Tailor of Mannyntree aforesaid about three years since; and this Examinant being asked why she did not dis∣cover it to the said Mary, she said, the Devil would not suffer her, and that the cause of the said Elizabeth Goodings malice against the said Mary was, because the said Mary refused to give to the said Elizabeth some Beeregood. And lastly, this Examinant saith, that about eight weeks since, this Examinant, the said Elizabeth Gooding, and one Anne West of Lawford widow, met together at the house of the said Elizabeth Clark, where there was a book read, wherein she thinks there was no goodness.

The Information of Grace the wife of Richard Glascock of Mannyntree, taken upon oath before the said Justices, the 11th day of April, 1645.
THis Informant saith, that there being some falling out between Mary the wife of Edward Parsley of Mannyntree, and one Hell∣len Clark, the wife of Thomas Clark (which said Helen is the daughter of the said Anne Leech, whose confession doth emma∣diately precede) this Informant heard the said Helen to say, as the said Helen passed by this Informants door in the street, that Mary the daughter of the said Edward and Mary Parsley should rue for all, whereupon, presently the said Mary the daughter, fell sick, and died within six weeks after.


The Information of Edward Parsley of Mannyntree, taken upon oath before the said Justices, April 11. 1645.
THis Informant saith, that his said daughter sickened very sud∣denly, as the said Grace Glascock hath before informed, and died about six weeks since; and this Informant doth verily believe, the said Helen Clark was the death of his said daughter.


The Examination of Helen Clark, taken before the said Justices the 11th of April, 1645.
THis Examinant confesses, [11] that about six weeks since, the De∣will appeared to her in her house, in the likeness of a white Dog, and that she calls that Familiar Elimanzer; and that this Examinant hath often fed him with milk-pottage; and that the said Familiar spake to this Examinant audibly, and bade her deny Christ, and she should never want, which she did then assent unto, but doth altogether deny the killing of the daugh∣la of the said Edward Parsley.

The Information of Prudence Hart, the wife of Thomas Hart of Lawford, taken upon oath before us the 23. of April, 1645.
THis Informant saith, that about eight week since, being at her Parish Church, on the Sabbath day, half a mile distant from her house, and being about twenty weeks gone with child, and to her thinking, very well and healthful, upon the sudden she was taken with great pains, and miscarried before she could be got home; and this Examinant saith, that about two months since, being in her bed, in the night, something fell down upon her right side, but being dark, she cannot tell in what shape it was: And that presently she was taken lame on that side, with extraor∣dinary pains and burning, but recovered again within a few days after: And this Informant further saith, that she verily believes, that Rebecca West, and Anne West her mother, were the cause of her pains; for that the said Rebecca hath in part of her Confess∣zion expressed, that she had much maliced this Informant, be∣cause the said Rebecca West ever thought this Informant to be her greatest enemy.


The Information of John Edes, Clerk, taken upon oath before the said Justices the 28th day of April. 1645.
THis Informant saith, That Rebecca West confessed unto him, that about seven years since, she began to have familiarity with the Devil, by the instigation of her mother Anne West; who hath appeared unto the said Rebecca at several times, in di∣verse shapes: At one time in the likeness of a proper young man, who desired of her, that he might have the same familiarity with her, that others that appeared unto her before had had: Promi∣sing that if she would, he would then doe for the said Rebecca what she desired, and avenge her on her enemies; but required further; that she would deny God, and rely upon him. Now there was one Thomas Hart of Lawford, where the said Rebecca

lived with her said mother, Anne West, and the said Rebecca told this Informant, that she required of him, that he would avenge her on the said. Hart by killing his son, who not long after was taken sick, and dyed, whereupon the said. Rebecca told this Infor∣mant, that she conceived he could do as God; after which time she gave entertainment to him, who lay with her as a man; and the said Rebecca further confessed to this Informant, that whilst she lived at Rivenall in the said. County of Essex, the said Anne her mother, came to the said Rebecca, and told her the Barley corn was picked up (meaning one George Frances (the only son of one George Frances, one of the chief Inhabitants of that town, where the said Anne West dwelt) and that his father thought the said George his son was bewitched to death; and the said Anne then said unto the said Rebecca, Be it unto him according to his faith.

The Confession of Rebecca West, [12] taken before the said Justices at Mannyntree, the 21. of March, 1645.
THis Examinant saith, that about a month since, the aforesaid Anne Leech, Elizabeth Gooding, Helen Clark, Anne West, and this Examinant, met all together at the house of the aforesaid Eli∣zabeth Clark in Mannyntree, where they together spent some time in praying unto their Familiars, and every one in order went to prayers; afterwards some of them read in a book, the book being Elizabeth Clerks; and this Examinant saith, that forthwith their Familiars appeared, and every one of them made their several Propositions to those Familiars, what every one of them desired to have effected: And this Examinant saith, that first of all the said Elizabeth Clark desired of her Spirit, that Mr. Edwards might be met withal about the middle bridge, as he should come riding from Eastberyhoult in Suffolk; that his Horse might be scared, and he thrown down, and never rise again: And this Examinant saith, that the said Elizabeth Gooding desired of her Spirit, that she might be avenged on Robert Tailors Horse, for that the said Robert suspected the said Elizabeth Gooding for the killing of an Horse of the said Robert formerly: And this examinant saith, that the said Helen Clark desired of her Spirit, that she might be reven∣general

on two Hogs in Mislay street, (being the place where the said Helen lived) one of the Hogs to die presently, and the other to be taken lame; and this Examinant further saith, that Anne Leeeb desired of her Spirit, that a Cow might be taken lame of a mans living in Mannyntree, but the name of the man this Exam∣nant cannot remember: And this examinant further saith, that the said Anne West, this Examinants mother, [13] desired of her Spy∣rit, that she might be freed from all her enemies, and have no trouble: And this Examinant saith, that she desired of her Spy∣rit, that she might be revenged on Prudence the wife of Thomas Hart, and that the said Prudence might be taken lame on her right side. And lastly this Examinant saith, that having thus done, this Examinant, and the other five, did appoint the next meeting to be at the said Elizabeth Goodings house, and so depar∣ted all to their own houses.

The Information of Richard Edwards of Mannintree, Gent. taken upon oath before the said Justices the 23th of April. 1645.
THis Informant saith, That not long since, about three months to his best remembrance, as he was coming from Eastberyholt in Suffolk, half an hour within evening; within ten score of the middle bridge (according to the desire of the said Elizabeth Clarke, as is declared in the confession of the said Rebecca West) this In∣formants horse started with him, and greatly endangered him; and he heard something about his horse cry, Ah, ah; much like the shriek of a Polecat. And this Informant saith, That with much difficulty he saved himself from being thrown off his horse. All which, this Informant reported to his wife and neighbours as soon as he came home.

But whether this was an Imp in the shape of a Liveried, or had any relation to the said Mary, this Informant knows not, but does confess she wondered very much to see a Liveried, wilde by nature, to come so frequently and sit openly be∣fore the door in such a familiar way.

The Examination of Susan Cock, [22] taken before the said Justices the 6. day of May, 1645.
THis Examinant saith, that about three or four years since, one Margery Stoakes, this Examinants mother, lying upon her death-bed, and this Examinant coming to visit her, she the said Margery desired this Examinant privately, to give entertainment to two of her Imps, and withal told this Examinant, they would do this Examinant good: And this Examinant saith, that the same night her said mother dyed, the said two Imps came to her accordingly, and sucked on he body: And this Examinant saith, that one of the said Imps was like a mouse, and the name of that was Susan; that the other was of a yellow colour, about the big∣ness of a Cat; and that the name of that Imp was Bess: And this Examinant saith, that she employed her said Imp called Bess, together with the Imps of the said Rose Hallybread, Joyce Bones, and Margaret Landish, each of them one, to the house of one John Spall, where the said Imps killed ten or twelve Sheep of the said John Spalls; and that the cause of this Examinants malice was, because she being with child, desired to have some curds of the said Spalls wife, which she refused, either to give or sell to this Ex∣eminent: And further, this Examinant saith, that about a week since, she, together with Joyce Bones, Rose Hallibread, and Mar∣garet Landish sent four Imps to the house of one Robert Tuener (by the said Joyce Bones) to torment his servant, for that the said

servant of the said Robert Turner refused to give to this Examinant a sack full of chips: And this Examinant further saith, that she, to∣gether with the said Margaret Landish, sent her Imp to the house of one Thomas Mannock in St Osyth aforesaid, where their said Imps killed six or seven shoots or hogs of the said Mr Mannock; and that the occasion of offence was, because the wife of the said Mr Mannock refused to give to this Examinant such relief as she de∣sired, telling this Examinant, that she was a young woman, and able to work for her living.

The Examination of Margaret Landishe, [23] taken before the said Justices the 6th day of May. 1645.
THis Examinant saith, That about eight or nine weeks since lying sick by the fire side in her own house, something came up to her body, and sucked on her privy parts, and much pained and tormented her: And this Examinant saith, that if it were an Imp that came and sucked her as aforesaid, that the said Susan Cock sent it to her: And this Examinant denies, that ever she joined with the said Joyce Bones, Rose Hallibread, and Susan Cock, in the tormenting of the servant of the said Robert Turner, & doth utterly deny the sending of any Imp to destroy or kill the hogs of the said Mr Mannock, as the said Susan Cock hath charged her withal in the Examination of the said Susan.


The Examination of Rebecca Jones of St Osyth, [24] taken before the said Justices the 9th of May. 1645.
THis Examinant saith, That about 24. or 25 years since, dwell∣ling with one John Bishop, of Much-Clacton in the County of Essex as his servant, there came one morning one to the door of the said John Bishop and knocked, and that this Examinant go∣ing to the door, she saw there a very handsome young man (as she then thought) but now she thinks it was the Devil; who asked this Examinant how she did, and desired to see her left Wrist, which she showed unto him: and that he then took a pin
from this Examinants own sleeve, and pricked her wrist twice, and there came out a drop of blood, which he took off with the top of his finger, and so departed. And this Examinant saith, that about a quarter of a year after, as she was going to St Osyth, (where this Examinant doth now dwell) to sell her said Masters butter, a man met with her, being in a ragged suit, and having such great eyes, that this Examinant was much afraid of him; who came to this Examinant, and gave her three things like to Mouses, having four feet apiece, but without tails, and of a black colour, and bid this Examinant nurse the said three things, until he did desire them again; And this Examinant asked the said man, what she should give them to eat, and he told this Exa∣minant milk, and that they would not hurt her, and wished her not to be afraid of them; And the said man told this Examinant, that those three things which he gave her, would avenge her on her enemies, and bid her murder some, but not too many, and he would forgive her; and then went away from this Examinant: And this Examinant saith, that the first time she employed any of the said things, she sent one of them to kill a Sow of one Banjo∣min Howes of Little-Clacton in the County aforesaid; and the said Sow was killed by the said Imp accordingly: And this Exam∣nant saith, that the names of her three Imps were Margaret, A∣my, and Susan: And that a while after, this Examinant and one Joyce Bones (now in prison) did send each of them an Imp to kill one Thomas Bumstead of St Osyth aforesaid, who died about three weeks after. And this Examinant saith, that she beleeveth that the said two Imps did kill the said Thomas Bumstead; and the Imps name which this Examinant sent to destroy the said Bum∣stead was Margaret: And that the Imp which the said Joyce Bones sent was a dund one like unto a Mouse. And this Examinant saith, that she did send another of her Imps called Amie, to the said Bumsteads house, which did kill the wife of the said Bumstead with∣in a short time after: And this Examinant confesses, that the cause of offence she took so to destroy and kill the said Bumstead and his wife, was because the said Thomas Bumstead did beat the son of this Examinant for eating up of some honey which he found about the house of the said Thomas Bumstead. And this Exa∣minant further confesses, that she did send her other third Imp


called Susan, to afflict the child of one Mistress Darcy of St Osyth a∣foresaid: But did withal bid the said Imp it should not hurt the said child too much, and come away again: And this Examinant saith, that the said Imp is come again from the said Mistress Dar∣cies child.

The Examination of Johan Cooper, widow, taken before the said Justices, May 9. 1645.
THis Examinant saith, [25] that she hath been a witch about twenty years, and hath three Familiars, two like Mouses, and the third like a Frog: The names of the two like Mouses, are Jack, and the other Prickeare, and the name of the third like a Frog, is Frog: And this Examinant saith, that she sent one of her said Imps to kill a child of one Thomas Woodward, which her said Imp did kill within a fortnight after: And this Examinant saith, that she did send her said Imp called Frog, to kill two of John Cartwrights i will∣drone, of Much-Holland in the County of Essex aforesaid, which said Imp did kill the said two children within a fortnight or three weeks after: And this Examinant saith further, that at another time she sent her said Imp Frog, to destroy the wife of one George Parby of Much-Holland aforesaid, which did kill her within three days after.


The Examination of Anne Cate, alias Maidenhead, of Much-Holland, in the County aforesaid, taken before the said Justices the 9th day of May, 1645.
THis Examinant saith, [26] that she hath four Familiars, which she had from her mother, about two and twenty years since; and that the names of the said Imps are James, Prickeare, Robin, and Sparrow: and that three of these Imps are like Mouses, and the fourth like a Sparrow, which she called Sparrow: And this Exam∣nant saith, that to whomsoever she sent the said Imp called Spar∣row, it killed them presently; and that first of all she sent one of her three Imps like mouses, to nip the knee of one Robert Freeman,
of Little-Clacton, in the County of Essex aforesaid, whom the said Imp did so lame, that the said Robert dyed on that lameness within half a year after: And this Examinant saith, that she sent her said Imp Prickeare to kill the daughter of John Rawlins of Much-Holland aforesaid, which died accordingly within a short time after; and that she sent her said Imp Prickeare to the house of one John Tillet, which did suddenly kill the said Tillet: And this Examinant saith, that she sent her said Imp Sparrow, to kill the child of one George Parby of Much-Holland aforesaid, which child the said Imp did presently kill; and that the offence this Exam∣nant took against the said George Parby to kill his said child, was, because the wife of the said Parby denied to give this Examinant a pint of Milk: And this Examinant further saith, that she sent her said Imp Sparrow to the house of Samuel Ray, which in a very short time did kill the wife of the said Samuel; and that the cause of this Examinants malice against the said woman was, because she refused to pay to this Exam∣nant two pence which she challenged to be due to her; And that afterwards her said Imp Sparrow killed the said child of the said Samuel Ray: And this Examinant confesses, that as soon as she had received the said four Imps from her said mo∣there, the said Imps spake to this Examinant, and told her, she must deny God and Christ, which this Examinant did then assent unto.

The testimony of Sir Thomas Bows, Knight, which he spake upon the Bench, concerning the aforesaid Anne West, she being then at the Bar upon her trial.
THat a very honest man of Mannintree, [27] whom he knew would not speak an untruth, affirmed unto him, that very early one morning as he passed by the said Anne Wests door, about four a clock, it being a moon-light night, and perceiving her door to be open so early in the morning, looked into the house, and present∣lie there came three or four little things in the shape of black rab∣bits, leaping and skipping about him, who having a good stick in his hand, struck at them, thinking to kill them, but could not, but

at last caught one of them in his hand, and holding it by the body, of it, he beat the head of it against his stick, intending to beat out the brains of it; but when he could not kill it that way, he took the body of it in one hand, and the head of it in another, and in∣devoured to wring off the head; and as he wrung and stretched the neck of it, it came out between his hands like a lock of wool; yet he would not give over his intended purpose, but knowing of a Spring not far off, he went to drown it; but still as he went he fell down, and could not go but down he fell again, so that he at last crept upon his hands and knees till he came at the water, and holding it fast in his hand, he put his hand down into the water up to his elbow, and held it under water a good, space, till he conceived it was drowned, and then letting go his hand, it sprung out of the water up into the air, and so vanished away: and then coming back to the said Anne Wests door, he saw her standing there in her smock, and asked her why she did set her Imps to molest and trouble him? to whom she made an∣swer, that they were not sent to trouble him, but were sent out as Scouts upon another design.
