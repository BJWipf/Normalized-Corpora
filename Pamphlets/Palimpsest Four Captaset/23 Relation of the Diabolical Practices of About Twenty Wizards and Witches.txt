To Sir T. M.
SIR,
ACcording to your Request, I send you Enclosed the Proceedings of the Commissioners appointed by the Lords of His Majestys most Honourable Privy Council, for enquiring into the Witches and Witchcrafts in the Shiriffdome of Renfrew, of which I have had Opportunity of knowing more than many others, as having been with the Commissioners on the Trials; And shall add nothing here, save what passed at the first Diet of the Trial, which was at Paislaw, where were Met of the Commissioners, my Lord Blantyre, my Lord Halcraig, Sir Iohn Maxwell of Polock, Mr. Francis Montgomery, Blackhall, Duchall, with several others, to the Number of Eleven. There was Deputed in the room of the King's Advocate, Three Advocates, viz. Mr. John Menzies, Mr. Grant and Mr. Stuart. The Panels being 21 in number, were frequently called to see if they could be brought to Confession; They were Confronted with Bargarens Daughter, and the three little Confessors, Elizabeth Anderson, and the two Lindsays. But they still denied all: which put the Court to Cull out 7 of them, against whom Threatenings, and some Malifice following could be proven. These were Margaret Lang, in Cartinpan, a Woman Famous for Religion, ever since the 60 year of God, and really a Person of extraordinary Gravity and Wisdom; I know not whether to call it Natural or Diabolical; but I have never heard a Woman speak so Gravely, Pertinently, and Religiously both to the Ministers and Judges then she did. The other were Katherine Campbell, Agnes Nasmith, John and James Lindsays, Agnes Fostur, and Margaret Fulton: This Kate Cambell is a young Well-favour'd Lass, 20 years of Age; but the rest most part Old, both Men and Women.

The Commissioners, after their first Assay to have them confess, before they brought them to a Formal Trial, would have them Tried by Pricking, which really to me seems strange, for there was not any of them, save Margaret Fulton, but Marks were found on them, which were altogether Insensible, That a Needle of 3 Inches length was frequently put in without their Knowledge, nor would any blood come from these places, and tho many, especially Doctors, ridiculed these as Stories, yet after we called Dr. Bisbin and Baird, and let them see a Needle

of a great length put into the top of one of the Vertibrae of the Back, and one into Margaret Lang, a handbreadth beneath her Ribs in the Region of the Lower Belly, they both thought it wonderful, being in a place where, in another Woman, the Needle could not but pierce the Guts: All the other 14 were also pricked and marks found in most of them. But I was most concerned for Martha Semple Daughter to Margaret Lang, who was most exactly searched twice, yet no mark found; tho the pricker mist not to search the very Soles of her Feet and other more Secret Places, for when there was any difficulty to find the mark they did quite uncloath them, but then it was in a Room, and not publicly, before one or two of the Justices, a Minister, one of the Advocatrs, and the Clark, my Lord Halcraig and I were only present with Martha; but really she is as well Favoured and Gentile a Lass as you'll look on, and about 17 or 18 years of Age, I took up Mr. Wily to her to see if he could bring her to any Confession, he spoke long to her but she denied all notwithstanding of what you see in the Encloased paper, but she was the only person amongst them all that ever I saw Weep.
They were at last on the 15th. of April to have been brought to their Trial, after 3 or 4 days trifling with them by pricking, and to bring some of them to Confession, but just as the Assize was constitute they moved to have a little more time to provide themselves Advocates, which the Justices yielded to, and adjourned to the 2d. Tuesday of May, and in this Interval the two Brothers did Confess, and upon Examination said the same things that the two Lindsays and Anderson had declared, as you have it in the within Paper. Another Man also confessed, But the Devil Strangled him in Prison, for he was found fitting in a Chair with a Cord about his Neck but slack and tied to no thing. After the Adjournment the Judges met again, and having Sufficient Evidence of several Mallefices done by each of the Seven above-named, with the Testimonies of the five Confessing Witches, all concurring in the same Acts, Sentenced them to be burned the 10th. of June, which was accordingly Executed. The other 14 being Respited till the Kings Advocates Pleasure, among whom is one Morrison Wife to Francis Duncan in Greenock called in the paper the Devils Gentlewife Antiochia, on whom many marks are found; of which you'll receive further Information by the Incloas'd to which I referr you, and am, Sir,

Your much obliged Humble Servant, T. P.

A NARRATIVE Of the RECOGNITION Taken by the Commissioners, Appointed by the Lords of His Majesties Privy-Council, for Enquiring into the Witchcrafts, and Witches, in the Shirrifdom of Renfrew; with Relation to the Afflicted Case of Christian Shaw, Daughter to the Lord of Bargarren. At the Place of Bargarren, Feb. 5. 1697. Present, the Lord Blantyre, &c.
THE said Christian Shaw, being Confronted with one Iames Lindsay (whom Elizabeth Anderson, one of the Confessing Witches Under-written Declared, Was one of the said Christians Troublers in her Fits) Did, upon
Touching the said Iames, take a very Violent Fit, Leaping, Starting and Staring, with such a Stiffning of all her Joints, that it was hard for the Assistants to keep her from Falling, and, at last, fell, as quite Dead, and Senseless, for some time; and, after Recovery, being Confronted with one Catherine Campbell, who being once Servant to her Father, for a Mis-representation of her to her Mistress, Cursed her; and is the Aledg'd Instrument of all the said Christian her Trouble. The said Katherine being by the said Commissioners Interrogate on several Points, in the Hearing of the said Christian, she Denied all, and particularly her Accession to the said Christian her Trouble, or the Rise thereof. But the Child still Charging her, Conjured her to tell the Commissioners, Why she would never Pray, That God would deliver her from that Ill, and Restore her well again. Katherine did not disown her Refusal, but shifted about for frivolous Excuses which the Commissioners bearing home on her, as a Great Argument of her Guilt; and finding she could hardly evade the Force of it, Katherine offers to run at the Child (they being then at some distance from one another) and the Child did all she could to shun her Touch. Katherine Complained; saying, Now I would Pray for her, but she will not let me. But the Child being forced to suffer her Touch by the Bystanders, the most Unwillingly, and with great Fear, she immediately after fell down, in a most Violent Fit, as before, on Iames Lindsay's Touch: But thereupon Katherines Tongue was loosed, and she said, The Lord Bless her, The Lord Deliver her; which nothing could Oblige her to do before: And the Child her self declared, after that Fit, and Katherines Prayer, she now found her self free of all Fear to Touch the said Katherine, or any other of her Tormentors.
The Commissioners were then Earnest with Katherine, to tell why she would, or could not Pray before she Touched the Child? But, to this, she could give no Satisfactory Answer.

Afterwards the Commissioners called a Young Damsel, Named Elizabeth Anderson, whom they found a very Useful Person in the said Enquiry, as being many times admitted by her
Father, and other Friends, to their Meetings with the Devil, as her Confession hereto Subjoined does Evidence, to which you are Referred. As also the Commissioners having Examined Christian Shaw, about the Persons Represented to her as her Tormentors in those Fits; and finding her Testimony Confirmed by Elizabeth Anderson her Confession, with relation to many of the Persons Accused by Christian. The Commissioners, on that Evidence, Ordered them all to Prison, (viz.) Alexander Anderson, Father to the said Elizabeth, Agnes Nasmith, Iohn Lindsay in Barrcloch, Iohn Lindsay in Formachin, Iames Lindsay his Brother, Agnes Foster, Margaret Fulton, and the said Katherine Campbell, where they are to lie till farther Orders. But the said Christian Shaw knows and remembers another Person, whom she declares she has not the Power to Name: And she has many times attempted it, but is still seized with Fits when she Assays to Express it; She came, at last, to say, for her first Name, Margaret, or Pinched Margaret (a Name given her by the Devil, from a Pinched Cross-Cloath, ordinarily worn on her Brow) But cannot express her Patronimick, or Surname. The Commissioners were so concerned at this, that they urged her to Write it, which being loath to try for fear of Torture, she nevertheless essayed it; And beginning to Write other Names, she was desired to try that too, but could Write no more save Margaret, and the Letter L. of her Surname, being presently taken with a most Violent Fit, the Pen falling out of her hand, and she falling Dead, as above, with Groans, heavier and sorer then ordinary. Within a while the Commissioners having cause her to take a little of a Julep, after her Recovery, some Ministers standing by, Presented her with a Bible, desiring her to Read a Passage in it, which they pointed to her; but no sooner had she cast her eyes on the Book, but instead of Reading, she fell to Sing a very Melodious Tune, such as is used in Opera's; and, within a little while after fell in her Fits again, and even then the Music ceased not, tho she appeared as one dead, with her Mouth open, but neither her Lips nor Tongue stirring, She remained long in the Fit, till one of the Commissioners,

desired the Book might be Closed; which done, she Immediately came to her Self; and being Asked what she meant by Singing, when she was desired to Read, she was not sensible she had Sung, and declared she did not remember it.

Bargarren-Place. Fibre. 5. 1697.
ELizabeth Anderson, Daughter to Alexander Anderson, Aged 17 years, or thereby, Declared that about 20 days ago, she was Invited by her Father, to go along with him to Bargarrin's Yard, about Twelve a Clock in the Day, who went both together; and having come there, they met with an Black Man, who had an Bonnet on his Head, and a Band about his Neck, whom her Father, and Agnes Nasmith, then present, told her, He was the Devil And that there was in Company with that Black Man, whom she thought was the Devil, the Persons following; viz. the said Alexander Anderson her Father, Agnes Nasmith in Park of Erskin, Iohn Lindsay in Formaken, called, The Bishop, Iames Lindsay his Brother, Margaret Fulton, Spouse to Robert Wallace in Kilpatrick, and Sister to the Grandmother of the said Elizabeth, who Dyed in Paisley Tolbooth, Accused of Witchcraft above half an Year since, or thereby.

And that the Devil, with the Company foresaid Danced all in the said Yard the time foresaid. And that her Father Discharged her to tell any thing she saw, or else she would be Torn
in pieces; And that she was more Afraid of the forsaid Persons, then she was of the Devil. And being Examined whether or no any Person in the Company foresaid Desired her to Engage in the Devil's Service? She declared, That both the Devil and her Father Invited her several times to the Devil's Service, Promising to Reward her for her pains But that she altogether refused to Engage therein: And that notwithstanding thereof, she went along to the foresaid Yard, to the said Meeting with her Father; Where she heard the Devil say, That no body would see them: At which the forsaids Persons then present did Laugh.

THE Copy of a Letter SENT, From Bargarrens Lady to him, being then at Ranfren, dated Fibre. 18. 1697.
My Dear,
I Thought it fit to give you an Account of Christians Condition, this day about two a Clock in the Afternoon she said she saw the Devil in likness of a Man, she seemed to be somewhat feared, and I desired her to say The Lord Rebuke thee Satan, but the use of her Tongue was taken from her, yet recovering it in a short space she asayed to speak, but was presently seized with a Fit, and when that was over she went about the Room deaf and blind as you your self have seen her before, but still speaking, as to a Bumbee, said, With the Lords Strength thou shalt not put Straw nor Sticks into my Mouth, holding her hand fast on her Mouth all the while, then walking a little faster

she cried out, the Bumbee is Stinging me, and sitting down looked on her Leg where was the Impression, very deep of finger Nails. The Devil appeared to her again in the Bed like a Gentleman, she standing at the Bed-side reasoned with him after this manner; Thou thinks to make me a Witch but through God's Strength thou shalt never be the better; I charge thee in the Name of God to be gon and thy Papers too, for I will have non of them, I will not fear thy ill, stand here see if thou dare come one stop nearer me: I think thou art feareder for me then I for thee; then turning she went up and down the Room as before, and again was bitten with Teeth in the hands very deep, and Impressed with Nails of Fingers more then twenty four times, which made her cry aloud every time she received them, and showing the place where she was hurt by getting her hand upon it; but we neither saw nor heard any thing about her. She continued in this Fit from two a Clock till past five at night, she said in the Fit Margaret Lang had given orders to Torment her, so by the Lass you will get a fuller account; till meeting; I remain
Your, &c. Sic Subscribitur, Christian M'gilchrist.
