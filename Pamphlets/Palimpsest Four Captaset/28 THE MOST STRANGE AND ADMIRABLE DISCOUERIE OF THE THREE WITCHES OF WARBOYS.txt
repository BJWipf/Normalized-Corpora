To the Right worshipful Master Edward Fenner one of the Justices of the court of her Majesties bench.

In these times (Right worshipful) wherein every idle wit seeks to blaze abroad their vainness, there ought to be no small care for the restraining of trivial Pamphlets, as well to exercise the Readers in matter necessary, as to cut off the writing of things needles.  Among other your worships care, as well for the furthering of the truth of this arraignment, being Judge at the trial of the malefactors, as also the crossing of whatsoever pamphlets should have been preferred, respecting either the matter partly or confusedly: emboldens me to prefer the patronage hereof to your Worship, not doubt but as you have been careful as well for the trial and judgment of such heinous offenders, and withal taken extraordinary pains in perfecting this work, for the printing to others example, you will likewise vouchsafe to pardon our boldness
To the Reader.

At length, though long first, gentle Reader, this notable arrainment and examinations of Samuel, his wife, and daughter, for their sundry witchcrafts in Huntingtonshire are com to view.  It hath for special cause been thus long deferd, as well that nothing might escape untouched which they had done, as that every thing might be thoroughly sifted least it should posse any way corruptly.  These cares having perfected the work, it is now past the press to your presence, wherein I presume ye shall find matter as admirable as ever this age afforded.


A True and particular Observation of a notable piece of Witchcraft practised by Iohn Samuel the Father, Alice Samuel the Mother, & Agnes Samuel their Daughter, of VVarboise in the County of Huntington, upon five Daughters of Robert Throckmorton of the same town and County Esquire, and certain other Maide-seruants to the number of twelve in the whole all of them being in one house: November, 1589.

About the tenth of November which was in the year 1589.  Mistress Iane one of the daughters of the said Master Throckmorton being near the age of ten years, fell upon the sudden into a strange kind of sickness and distemperature of body, the manner whereof was as follows.  Sometimes she would neese very loud and thick for the space of half an hour together; and presently as one in a great rance and sound lay quietly as long, soon after she would begin to swell and heave up her belly so as none was able to bend her, or keep his down, sometime she would shake one leg and no other part of her, as if the palsy had bin in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of his arms and then the other, and soon after his head, as if she had bin in fected with the running palsy: continuing in this case two of three days, amongst other neighbours in the town there came into the house of master Throckmorton, the foresaid Alice Samuel to visit this sick child, who dwelled in the next house on the Northside of the said Master Throckmorton.  The child when the old woman came into the parlour was held in an other women's arms by the fire side, so she went into the chimney corner and sate

down hard by the child, the Grandmother of the child, and the Mother being also present, she had not been there long, but the child grue something worse than she was at her coming, and on the sudden cried (saing) Grandmother look where the old witch sits (pointing to the said mother Samuel) did you ever see (said the Child) one more like a witch than she is: Take off her blacke-thrumbed cap, for I cannot abide to look on her.  The mother of the child little then suspecting any such matter (as afterwards fell out) was very angry with her child and rebuked her for saying so, & thinking that it might proceed of some lightness in the child's brain by reason of her great neesing and want of sleep, took her and laid her down upon a bed, and hanged curtains against the windows, thereby hoping to bring her into a sleep, but much ado they had to pacify and quiet the child.  The old woman hearing this sate still, and gave never a word, yet looked very ruefully, as afterwards was remembered by them that saw her.  The child still continuing her manner of sickness, rather worse than better, within two days after, her parents sent the child's urine to Cambridge to Doctor Barrow, a man well known to be excellent skilful in Physic, who returned this answer: namely, that he did perceive no kind of distemperature save only that he thought she might be troubled with worms, and therefore sent his medicine accordingly, but the child was no white the better; so within two days after they sent again to the same man, declaring unto him the manner of her fits more at large: he said that the urine which they then again brought to him, showed no such kind of disquietness to be in her body: and to be failling sickness (which the Parents did suspect to be in the child) he would warrant her clear from that disease.  Then he sent other prescripts as he thought good to purge her body, which took no place nor prevailed any thing in the child as he looked for.  Then the Parents sent to him the third time (as his desire was to understand howe his Physic wrought) declaring that it wrought nothing at all as he looked for, neither that the child was any way amended.  Then Mister Doctor looking again in the urine, and perceiving the child's body to bee in good temper (as he then said for any thing that he saw) demanded whether there was no sorcery or witchcraft suspected in the child, answer was made no.  Then said he, all surely cannot be well, for it is not

possible, that the child's body should be distempered by any natural cause as then was declared to him, and no sign thereof at all to appear in the urine: not withstanding for their better assurance (if the messenger woule go to any other skifull man in the town to take further advise, he said he would bee very well contented.  Whereupon the messenger went to Master Butler, who considering of the urine, and hearing the manner of the child's trouble said, that he thought it might be the worms, which yet he did not perceive to be by the urine and if it were the worms, that then it was a very strange kind of grief to bee caused by them in that sort, and appointed the same medicine and physic (for the remedy) which before Doctor Barrow had prescribed: which being known was not applied to the child, because Master Doctor Barrow had said that if Master Throckmorton (to whom he wished very well as he then said, by reason of ancient acquaintance with him) would follow his advice, he should not strive any more there with by Physic, nor spend any more money about it: for he himself said, that he had some experience of the malice of some witches, and he verily thought that there was some kind of sorcery & witchcraft wrought towards his child.

After which answer from Master Doctor Barrow, Master Throckmorton resolved himself to rest upon Gods pleasure, not striving any further by Physic to help his daughter; yet both himself and his wife were free from any such conceit of witchcraft which Master Doctor Barrow did suspect; until within one ijst month after (the very day and hour almost observed) two more of his daughters elder than the other by two or three years, fell into the same like extremities as the other Sister before them was in, and cried out upon Mother Samuel: saying, take her away, look where she stands here before us in a black thrumbd Cap, (which kind of Cap indeed she did usually wear, but she was not then present) it is she (said they) that hath bewitched us, and she will kill us if you doe not take her away.  This thing did something move the Parents, and strike into their minds a suspicion of witchcraft, yet devising with themselves for what cause it should be wrought upon them or their children, they could not image, for they were but newly come to the town to inhabit, which was but at Michaelmas before, neither had they given any occasion (to their

knowledge) either to her or any other, to practise any such malice against them.

Within less than a Month after that, another Sister younger than any of the rest about the age of nine years fell into the like case, and cried out of Mother Samuel as the other did.

Soon after Mistress Join the eldest Sister of them all, about the age of fifteen years, was in the same case & worse handled indeed than any of the other Sisters were, for she having more strength than they, and striving more with the Spirit than the rest, not being able to overcome it, was the more grievously tormented; for it forced her to neese, screetch & groan very fearfully, sometime it would heave up her belly, and bounce up her body with such violence, that had she not bin kept upon her bed, it could not but have greatly bruised her body, & many times sitting in a chaier having her fit, she would with her often starting, and heaving, almost break the chaier she sate in: yet was there no striving with them in this case, for the more they laboured to help them & to keep them down, the more violently they were handled, being deprived of all use of their senses during their fits, for they could neither see, hear, nor feel any body; only crying out of Mother Samuel, desiring to have her taken away from them, who never more came, for after she perceived her self to be suspected.

These kide of fits would hold them, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter, either an hour or two sometimes half the day, yea the whole day, and many times they had six or seven fits in an hour, yet when it pleased God to deliver them of their fits, they neither knew what they had said, neither yet in what sort they had bin dealt with all as hereafter shall be declared in particular.

After that Mistress Join had bin thus handled a while, the Spirit as it should seem would sound in her ears some thing which she would declare in her fit, and amongst the rest, it showed unto her one time, that there should bee twelve of them which should be bewitched in that house, in one sort or other, and named them all unto her, being all women kind, and servants in the house, her self and her Sisters being five of the number, all which proved afterwards very ture, for they had all their several griefs, and most of them aflicted in the same sort and manner as

these five Sisters were, Of whom and the manner of their faith, if it should bee written in particular how they were dealt withal, there would be no end of this book.

And this may suffice to be known concerning the servants, that when they first fell into their fits, they all cried out of Mother Samuel, as the Children did, saying take her away Mistress, for Gods sake take her away and burn her, for she will kill us all if you let her alone, having the same miseries and extremities that the children had, and when they were out of their fits they knew no more than the children did, what either they had done or said: and presently upon their departure from Mistress Throckmortons house they were all very well, as at any time before, & so have continued ever since without suspicion of any such kind of vexations, and those servuantes that came in their places for the most part of them, they were aflicted in the like sort as the other for the space of two years together.

Upon Friday, being Saint Ualentines even, the thirteenth of February in the two & thirteth year of her Majesties reign, Gilbert Pickering of Thichmersh grove, in the county of Northampton Esquier, being uncle to the said Child, and hearing how strangely they were vexed and troubled went to VVarboyse (as well as to visit and see them, as also to comfort their Parents: coming to the house where they were, found them all at that present very well, as any children could bee and about one half hour after, the said Master Pickering was informed that one Mistress Andley and Master VVhittell of Saint Tues, and others were gone to the house of Mother Samuel to persuade his to come to see, and to visit the said Children, and because they tarried lunge, it seemed to the said Master Pickering that they could not bring his, although that the said Mother Samuel, had often said, she would come to the said children, whenever it pleased their Parents to send for her, and she would venture his life in water up to the chin; and loose some part of his best blood to doe them any good: but now as it seemed, her mid was clean altered, the cause was as it was suspected, for that all the said children (as it is said before) in their fits cried out of her, saying that she had bewitched them, and that she also feared, the common practise of scratching would be used on her, which nothing less

at that present was intended, for both the Parents and the said M. Pickering had take advice of good Divines of the unlawfulnes thereof, wherefore the said M. Pickering went to Mother Samuells house, as well to see her, as also to persuade her that, if she were any cause of the Childrens trouble, that it might bee amended, who coming to the said house, found there the foresaid Master Whittle, Mistress Andley, and others persuading her to visit the said Children, but she with loud speackes utterly refused the same, whereupon, the said Master Pickering told Mother Samuel that he had authority to bring her and if she would not go with him willingly and of her own accord, he would force her, and compel her whether she ewould or no, which he then did, together with her daughter Agnes Samuel, & one Cicely Burder, who were all suspected to bee witches, or at the least in the confederacy with Mother Samuel, and as they were going to the said Master Throckmortons house, Master VVhettle Mistress Andley, and others going before Mother Samuel, Agnes Samuel, and the said Cicely Burder in the middle part, and the said M. Pickering behind them, the said Master Pickering perceiving that old Mother Samuel would have willingly talked with her daughter Agnes, but the said Master Pickering followed so near behind them, that they could not confer, and when they came to the door of Master Throckmortons house, Mother Samuel used courtesy to the said Master Pickering, offering him to go into the house before his, which he refused, & in the entry of that same house(for either then or not at all) she thought that she should have had had time to speak to her daughter: the said Mother Samuel did thrust his head as near as she could to her daughters head, & said these words. I charge three doe not confess any thing, which the said Masiter Pickering, being behind them perceiving thrust his head as near as he could between their heads whilst the words were spoken and hearing them, presently replied to old Mother Samuel, thou naughty woman, dost thou charge thy daughter not to confess any thing, nay saith she I said not so, but I charged her to hasten his self home to get his Father his dinner. In the mean time, whilst these words were in speaking M. VVhittle Mistress Andley, and others went into the house, and three of the Children were then standing in the hall by the fire perfect well, but no sooner had

Mother Samuel entered the hall, but at one moment, the said three Children fell down upon the ground strangely tormented, so that if they had bin let lie still on the ground, they would have leaped & sprung like a quick Pickerel newly taken out of the water their bellies heaving up their head, & their heals still touching the ground as though they had bin tumblers, and would have drawn their heads and their heals together backwards, throwing out their arms, with great groans most strangely to bee heard, to the great grief of the beholders, but not lunge after they were thus fallen to the ground, the said Master Whittle took up one of the said Children, which was Jane Throckmorton, & carried her into an inward chamber laying her upon a bed, and being a man of as great strength as most be this day in England and the child not above nine years old, yet he could not hold her down on the bed, but she would heave up her belly far bigger and in higher measure for her proportion, than any woman with child ready to be delivered, her belly being as hard as though there had bin for the present time a great loaf in the same, and in such manner it would rise and fall an hundred times in the space of an hour, her eyes being closed as though she had bin blind and her arms spread abroad, so stiff and strong, that the strength of a man was not able to bring them to his body: then the said Master Pickering went into the Parlour where the said child was, and standing on the further side of the bed from the child viewing the order of her, presently the said child stretched forth her right arm, to that side of the bed next to the said Master Pickering, and there scratching the covering of the bed said these words very often, Oh, that I had her, Oh that I had her: whereupon, the said Master Pickering was in great admiration what the meaning of the said words should tend unto, and the rather for that the said Master Gilbert Pickering was of that opinion, that scratching was merely unlawful, yet the said Master Pickering put his own hand to the childes hand whilst she was speaking the words, but the child feeling his hand would not scratch it, but she forsook his hand and scratched still on the bed, her face being turned to the contrary side from the said Master Pickering, her eyes being closed, & Master Whittle lying in a manner with his whole body and weight over her, to hold down her
belly, fearing that she would have burst her back.

Not withstanding, the occasion being thus offered by the child, or rather by the Spirit in the child to disclose some secret, whereby the Witches might be by some means or token made manifest and known, the said Master Pickering went into the Hall and took Mother Samuel by the hand (who went as willingly as a Bear to the stake) and brought her to the further side of the bed from the child, who lay scraping with her nails on the bed covering, saying, Oh that I had her, then the said M. Pickering in very soft speeches (so that the child could not hear) said to Mother Samuel put your hand to the childes hand, but she would not then the said Master Pickering for examples sake, put his hand to the childes hand, so did also Mistress Andley & others at the same instant, but the child would scarce touch, much less scratch any of their hands, then the said Master Pickering without either malice to the woman, confidence, or opinion in scratching (only to taste by this experiment whereto the childes words would tend) took Mother Samuels hand and thrust it to the childes hand, who no sooner felt the same but presently the child scratched her, with such vehemence that her nails brake into Spills with the force and earnest desire that she had to revenge: whilst the child was thus scratching, the said Master Pickering did cover Mother Samuels hand with his own hand, to try what the child would doe in this extraordinary passion, but the child would not scratch his hand, but felt to and fro on upon the bed for that which she missed, and if by any means she could come with her hand, or but with one of her fingers to touch Mother Samuells hand, she would scratch that hand only and none other: Yea, sometimes, whilst the said Master Pickering with his hand did cover mother Samuels hand, the said child would put one of her fingers between the fingers of the said Master Pickering, and scratch mother Samuels hand that lay nethermost with that one finger, all her other fingers lying on the hand of the said Master Pickering without moving.

And in this passion, if at any time mother Samuels hand had been hidden or withdrawn from the child, she would have mourned and showed apparent tokens of dislike, as though there had been some great discourtesy offered, and this is to bee noted

for a most certain truth, for so it was by the said Master Pickering at the Assizes in Huntington given in evidence, that the Child s eyes were closed, so that she could not see any person, for so was the order of their Fits; and though she at that present could have seen, yet the childes head and neck were so turned backward into Master Whettels bosom who covered (as before is said) both her head, face, and body, with his body, in such fore so close, that it was unpossible for the child to see the company which stood on the further side of the bed.

This being done, the said Master Pickering departed out of that place into an other Parlour, where there was a woman holding one of the other children, which child as the said master Pickering passed by, scraped the women's Apron that held her, saying: Oh that I had her, Oh that I had her. Then the said master Pickering went into the hall, and did bring Cicely Burder to the said child, and for brevity sake, as the said master Pickering did with mother Samuel to the first child, so did he to Cicely Burder, and as the first child did to mother Samuel, so this second child did to Cicely Burder in all respects.

There was also a third child also at that present in the hall, which spake the same words, but the father of the children, and master Doctor Dorington Parson of the same parish, came then into the house, not allowing that which was done, by reason whereof the third was not put in proof.

The same night after supper, the children being all very well, and out of their Fits, master Doctor Dorington made motion to have some prayers before the company departed, the company then kneeling down, Doctor Dorington began to pray; but  no sooner had he uttered the first word, but even at one instant of time all the children fell into their Fits, with such terrible scrikes and strange neesings, so wonderfully tormented, as though they should have been torn in pieces, which  caused Doctor Dorington to stay in the midst of his prayers, and said these words or the like in effect, were we best to go any further: but he had no sooner made stay, and his breath stayed from praying, but the children were quiet (but still in their Fits) then he began to pray again, and then the children or rather the wicked spirit in the children forced them as before, this was proved often in the time of  

prayer for when he had made an end of any one prayer the children ceased and were quiet: when he began to pray, they began to scrike: when he ended, they ended.

The next day, being Saint Valentines Day, the said Master Pickering brought home to his house at Titchmersh Grove aforesaid, one of the said children called Elizabeth Throckmorton being in her fit, who no sooner being on horseback, and out of Warboyse Town, but she was well, and so she continued till she came into the said Master Pickering's house, but no sooner had she entered into the house, but that the fit took her suddenly gasping being not able to speak, only thus it comes, she pitched her self backewards, all the joints of her back bone being as it were drawn together, thrusting out her belly so strongly, that none could bend her back again, being very strong and heavy, shaking her limbs, and oftentimes her head when it rises so high, but specially her arms, like to those which struggle and plunge betwixt life and death, being both dumb, deaf and blind, her eyes closed up. Now this held her not a quarter of an hour, but with a gasp she came again to her self, stroking her eyes as though she had been but a sleep.

Sometimes, being taken in her feet, she is but deaf only when she can speak, or rather (as wee think) the spirit in her, but very vainly, and she can see also, but with a small glimmering when, if you look upon her, ye would deem her to have no sight at all. Sometimes also she can hear only, and not every body, but someone whom she likes and chooses out from the rest, sometimes she sees only, and as plainly as any other, but neither hears nor speaks any thing, her teeth being set in her head, sometimes both hearing and seeing very well, and yet not able to speak.

Above all things she delights in play: she will pick out someone body to play with her at Cards, and but one only, not hearing, seeing, or speaking to any other, but being awake, she remembers nothing that she did, heard, or spake, affirming that she was not sick but only slept.

She continued well until night, and before Supper in time of thanksgiving, it vexed her very strangely, taking her at the very name of grace, and holding her no longer than grace was in

saying: She sate very well at the Table, but no sooner had she put up her knife, but it pitched her backewardes, then being taken from the table, she was well until thanksgiving, all which time she was most grievously vexed and no longer. Afterwards she was very quiet and well until motion was made for prayers, all which time it seemed as though it would have rent her in pieces, with such,  scratching, and outcries, and vehement neesing, as that it terrified the whole company, but prayers being ended she was quieter, but still in her fit.

Then Master Pickering, and others that were acquainted with the manner of it, said, that if any should read the Bible, or any other Godly book before her, it would rage as before so long as they read, but because it was a thing very strange, and therefore hardly believed, one did take a Bible and read the first Chapter of Saint John the first verse: At the hearing whereof she was as one besides her mind, when he that read held his peace she was quiet: when he read, again it tormented her: when he ceased, it ceased: this divers did prove many times.

Nay at the motion of any good word, as if any that stood by chanced to name God, or prayed God to bless her, or named any word that teuded to God or Godliness, it raged all one as if any had read or prayed by her, and thus she was carried to bed still continuing in her Fit.

In the morning, being a Sabbath day, she came down into the Hall towards prayer time, and being asked whether she would tarry the time of prayers or not, she answered that she would doe as they would have her.  Then was she asked whether she could read, she said that she could once, but she had almost forgotten now: Then being asked further whether she had prayed that day, she made answer it would not suffer her: then whether she used to pray at home, she answered that it would not give her so much time.

Then one said to her, sith it will not suffer you to pray, not any other (seeming to have ears), pray to your self secretly in your hart and spirit, and beginning to tell her that God understood the inward sighs and groans of the hart, as well as the loudest cries of the mouth; She suddenly fell into her Fit being more strongly and strangely tormented than ever she was before,

and being carried away, her fits continued and increased  all prays time albeit she was out of the hearing, which such vehement cries, scratching and continual neesing, that many times prayers were constrained to be ceased for the time, so much it amazed the whole company: prayers being ended, she came her self with a gasp, wiping her eyes being presently as well as any body, as though it had never been she.

She came down to dinner, and during the time of grace, it held her again (which as is usual) yet will it suffer better another to say grace than her self, but no body well: At dinner time it plaid with her, so sometimes she hath merry fits, putting her hand besides her meat and her meat besides her mouth, mocking her, and making her miss her mouth, whereat she would sometimes smile, and sometimes laugh exceedingly, and amongst many other things this is worthy to bee noted, that being in her fit she looked far more sweetly and cheerfully than when she is awake: and although being tormented most pitifully, that it would have grieved any to see it, yet being once awaked and out of her fit she is as well as any body. At length Master Gibert Pickering called to mind and experiment which was made at Waboyse, which was, that if one took any of those children in their Fits, and carried them into the Churcharde which is adjoining to the house, they presently awaked, but bring them in again they were as before, carry them forth, and they came to themselves: go into the house and immediately their Fit took them, and this was as often found to be true as proved. Hereupon we proved the like with this child, and carried her out of the house, and she presently recovered, but within the house it took her again.

But the certainty of this failed us soon (as Satan is most uncertain) yet for three days space, if she were carried abroad in her Fit, it would leave her, and not take her again until she was brought into the house.

Hereof we rejoiced greatly with thanksgiving to God for the childes release in some sort. Hereupon arose a question amongst the divers that were present at that time what they thought thereof, same said one thing some another, in the end it was thought that the Spirit had it not in commission to molest her abroad, because he is but a Vassal to the wicked purpose of her that detains him.  

As the Angel of God said unto Lot, I can doe nothing till this be come thither, much less may the Angels of Satan go beyond their commission. But when this imagination was concluded upon, and once uttered forth, the said experiment presently failed; For now contrarily when she was carried abroad, you would have thought the child had been in danger of rending and utter spoiling, which did greatly fear and amaze the best that did see it.  But it would be too long to show all the tricks and collusions of Satan in wresting and over-ruling all the parts and members of this child, yet some pranks of his newfangled  nature shall be reported, who is the prince of this world, and a ring-leader of new fashions.

The observations of certain days follow, from the sixteenth of February to the 26, of that month, she was taken most commonly five or six times a day, sometimes ten times, sometimes twice, sometimes once, but not until night. On the seventeenth of February she could not refrain from gasping and gaping, and being demanded the cause, she answered, that if forced his thereunto. She was then persuaded to strive against it, and to shut her mouth, or so to stop it, but still she could not refrain, until the end, by much strife and contention she overcame it, yet not before it was said in her hearing, that the spirit was thought to be a spirit of the air, entering by a breath and departing by a breath, because it was an usual sign of his present awaking out of her fit and recovery, when she stretched his arms, often gasping, and long, with a little rubbing of her eyes, and thus this continual gasping ceased with her, but only at suchtimes, as when she awaked out of his fit.

On the 26. of February she read, and song Psalms, being well all day until the evening, when she being in her fit she cried out upon the aforesaid mother Samuel, fearing and crying, that she would put a mouse into his mouth, sometimes a cat, a frog, and sometimes a Toad, clapping his hands before his mouth. Suddenly in this fear, she start out of ones arms that held his, and ran away out of the doors into another room, where suddenly his legs failed his, an was catched up by one that followed his, still crying away with your mouse mother Samuel, I will none of your mouse after which time she imagined she had a mouse in her belly.

The 27. of February she was partly well, yet in her fit al the day long, being broad awake, yet nodding at every second word, as if she had been drowsy many times with meat in her mouth, or whatsoever she did, she gave a nod with the head, and that very low every minute. This drowsy fit as sleeping and yet awake, continued near two days.

The 28. whereas before it bended her backwards, now it bended her forwards, coveting to touch the ground, as if she would have stood upon her head, turning her hands clean backwards: and if any moved her contrary to her bending, all that present she would cry out, being in danger of breaking her limbs, neither were any able to bend her straight.

The first day of March at dinner time, she fell into such sore neesing about forty times together, & faster then one could well count them, in so much that blood issued out of her nose and mouth, but al night in bed, she fell into the most sorrowful fit of all, weeping with sobs and sighs most pitifully to hear with a strong imagination, crying and could not be appeased (for her senses were all benumbed) saying that now the Witches would kill her Father, destroy both her and al her sisters, this continued above two hours after in a sleep she fell into a sore bleeding, at the least a pint at both the nosetrils and the mouth.

In the morning being awaked she remembered no such thing , not that she bled at all. The second of March she had all merry fits, full of exceeding laughter (as they were al often times in their fits) and that so heartily and excessively, as that if they had been awaked they would have been ashamed thereof, being also full of trifling toys, and some merry jests of her own devising, whereat she would force both the standersby, and her self to laugh greatly.  In this fit she did choose one of her uncles to go to cards with her, as desirous therefore to see the end of it, they played together: soon after there was a book brought and laid before her, whereat presently she flung herself backwards, which being taken away, she presently recovered and played again: this was often proved and found true. And thus playing at cards, her eyes were almost clean shut, but the sight of her eyes were clean covered, she saw the cards and nothing else, she knew her uncle and no man else, she hard and answered him, and none other, she perceived him when he played foul, or did steal from

her, her counters or cards, but any other might take them out of her hands, she not seeing or feeling.  Sometimes she would choose another, whom she did see, and hear, sometimes a little child, but ever one and no more in any one fit. The fifth day of March she fell into a mourning fit, and longed to go home to her fathers: on the first day one of her fathers men came over to Tichmersh grove, whom she had often called for in her fit to carry her to Warboyse to her Fathers, saying, that if she were but half way, she knew that she should be well, desirous therefore to prove it, he carried her over horse back towards Warboyse, & being scarce gone a bow that, at a pond side she awaked, marveiling where she was, not knowing any thing, but no sooner the horse head was turned back, but she fell into her fit again.  This was often proved at that time to bee true, now this also fell out infallible: for three days after, and no longer, so often as she was carried to the pond (as many strangers desired to see her well and out of her fit) she awaked, and was very well, but returning her face only she fell again.

The eight day of March she caught a new kind of going antique wife, she could go very well two steppes, but the third she halted downright, giving a beck with her head as low as her knees, and as she was sitting by the fire, she suddenly start up, saying, that she would go to Warboyse, but she was stayed at the portal door, where going out with a nod, hit her forehead against the latch, which raised a knob the bigness of a Walnut, it being carried afterwards to the pond, where awaking she asked how her face came so hurt. There she was left all day well, playing in the company of other children at bowls and other sport (for the more foolish sport she uses, the more the spirit spares her: but so soon as any motion was made of coming into the house, it presently took her, so that she was never out of her fit within doors for twelve days together eating and drinking in her fit, but neither, seeing, hearing, nor yet understanding, clean without memory, yet speaking, or rather the spirit within her.  The 9. of March she could not go but hop, for the one leg was drawn uppe and would not touch the ground by a foot, and then being carried to the pond, she awaked now, and her leg was restored. This failed not for other three days, but still she went but upon one leg in the house.

The tenth day after she had eaten some milk, she listened and

hearkened (as often she would doe) demanding whether no body heard the spirit in his belly lapping the milk which she had eaten.

Then she began to dislike all bad things, and delighted in reading saying, that the spirit loved no goodness: therefore she burned all the cards that she could come by, she would read when you would have though she could not have seen the book, but sometimes it quite closed his eyes, sometimes it tied his tongue, sometimes it set her teeth, sometime it would fling away the book, especially at any good word, if she could catch the book, and be able to hold it still by striving, she would clap it fast to his face, until she could see, for sometimes in her reading, it would fling his backwards, & swell his belly in such sort and strange wise, that strong men were not able to hold her down, in so much that she would complain his self, can no man hold me down, yet the child was not then ten years old.

The eleventh day one chanced to ask her, or rather the spirit in his: love you the word of God: whereas she was sore troubled and vexed. But love you Witchcraft? it seemed content: or love you the Bible? Again, it shaked his, but love you Papistry: it was quiet. Love you prayers: it raged. Love you the Mass: it was still. Love you the Gospel? again it heaved up his belly: so that what good thing soever you named, it miss-liked, but whatsoever concerning the Popes paltry, it seemed, pleased, and pacified.

Then the twelfth day she was carried unto the pond, but she halted still, for there is no truth in or certainty in the Author of lies.

The 13, 14, and 15, days she passed away the time in a heavy fit, on the 16. day in the afternoon, she start up suddenly and ran out of the place where she was, and awaked in the way, but at five of the clock it took her again, until the next day three of the clock; but at five it took her again: and this also failed the third day: yet sitting at supper, she awaked whereat one said, thanks be to God: at which very words, she fell backwards into her fit again.

It follows to declare, as it hath been further very truly obseued in this child Elizabeth Throckmorton, remaining at Tichemarsh grove, that every month from March to Julie she hath had some vexation of body, which is termed by the name of fits, because of the divers manners thereof, so that she was never


clear and perfectly freed as it may be thought since her first visitation, although in some of the months she had but only one fit. And now because it seems to give a fresh one-set and a new attempt upon her, we have noted in particular wise how she hath been diversely handled.

For the manner of it, you have heard before to be very strange. It is first perceived commonly to be in her belly, by the great swelling and heaving up thereof from thence, it arises up into her throat stopping the passage of her breath, so that she is oftentimes forced to draw the same with great difficulty and streightues. Remaining there, it ties her tong many times, and sets her teeth together: It will further ascend up into her head, and shake the same as if she had the palsy, benumbing all her parts, and depriving her of the use of her senses, sometimes it will be in her arms and hands after the same manner, sometimes in one place, many times in another, and sometimes in all places at once.

For the continuance of it it hath bin either short or longer, mild or more vehement (as it pleased God to permit) for it hath always from the beginning kept a very mutable and uncertain course in dealing with them.

Now the 29 of July 1590, she had a fit from noon until night sleeping the most part of the time, upon the thirty she had three several fits in the afternoon going to bed in her fit, but all of them were very mild and without any such vehement plunges, and excessive neesing as in former times.

Upon the second of August presently after dinner she fell very suddenly (as many times before) into her ordinary manner of fits, not having so much liberty as to say it comes, which words she commoly used to utter in a great hast immediately before the assault, which was very strong and troublesome at this time: yet towards the end, she fell into a sleep, and so continued until supper times, when awaking she was very sick, and complained that she was griped at her heart and belly, and indeed marvel, for it had sore vexed her; In this sickly fit she remained the three next days following, eating very little, yet without any apparent sign of swelling or other troublesome fits until the 5. day when she had some few twiches, and some after awakened, yet not ceasing to complain of grief & pain at her hart and belly. But the next day morning all pain ceased,
and then she fell to her meat cheerfully, and was very well as at any time before. But Satan, the malignant spirit (for it was without question that disquieted the child) envied her long and good estate, for the same night, before she went to bed, she had two grievous fits, which caused many tears to fall from her eyes, as also from them that stood by, and so she was carried to bed. The next morning she was found to be in her fit, and so continued the whole day, being in her fit, and in her bed, lying as one in a drowsy sleep, eating and drinking in her fit, speaking very little, but sometimes saying she would go to Warboyse, for there her sisters were well (as she said) and named some of them whereas when she is out of her fit, she is loath to bee drawn any place from Tichmarsh grove.

The next day was the 13. of August, she was taken by in her fit and made ready, but when she should come to move her self, the one of her legs was drawn close to her body, almost a foot from the ground, so she sate in a chair al the day receiving her meat at due times when it was brought unto her, yet never moved her countenance, appearing as one in a trance; bereft of sense and motion, yea, and life (to look upon) save that she breathed: yet would she of her self (for she could neither hear, see, nor speak to any) lift up her hands in a little token of thanksgiving after meat received, (which is not to be omitted) because it was comfortable to be the beholders.

The 14. of August she was carried abroad into the open ayre to see if she could come to her self (as divers times in her former fits she had done) but there is now no change in her, she is the same without the door as within, and now she begins to complain on that side whereof the leg is drawn up, if any doe but touch her thereon, she will whimper and groan as if it were sore, yet there is no appearance of outward hurt, if you touch her on the other side, she will laugh after a [???] manner, and look merrily in the countenance, but there is not one word with her all the day long, from this day until the eight of September, for she was a whole month together in her drowsy fit. Many things happened worthy the remembrance, as that sometimes she would sow all the day long, and morn if her work were taken from her, sometimes she would mind yarn, or knit, but never cast up her
eyes or countenance, some days again she would bee merry and lightsome, finding many things wherein she would take delight, as playing with her cousins (children in the house) at some light and childish sports, wherein children doe pastimes themselves, and all in her fit, as if she were as perfect as any of them.

Sometimes again she would be so heavy and drooping, that she could not sit in her chair, but would cast her self on the ground, and so lie with a cushen or pillow under her head half the day together. Sometimes she would take a book and read either chapter or prayers very well, but whenever she misread a word, or slipped in any thing, she could not hear any that corrected her, though he had spoken never so loud, yet if he had pointed to the place with his finger, or given some other sign, she would have gone back and read over the place again, sometimes reading it true, sometimes not: Again, when she came to this word Satan, or the devil, she should have much to doe, to posse it quickly, or to keep the book in her hands, for it would shake her arms, and strain her body very sore, insomuch that she would oftentimes say, wilt though not suffer me to say my prayers: Wilt thou not suffer me to read: (answering) I will say them, I will read, with often and vehement repetition, and would in no case forsake her book, except by great strife and violence, it cast it forth of her hands (as many times it did) yet  would not receive it again, being brought unto her, and many times fetch it her self: and in the end after much contention and much striuings she should read quietly: and thus she was used for the most part every night when she went to bed, but especially in time of her prayers.

Further, for the space of two or three days, if Satan had been named, or the devil unto her, it would have troubled her, and so often those words had been named, so many twitches, which was very strange to behold: Also at the naming of Mother Samuel (which will not bee forgotten) it would shake her by the shoulders and arms, as if it would shauer her in pieces, giving signs of great dislicke thereof, and threatening as if there were some mystery in it.  And sometimes her very name would cast her presently into her fit, and being in the midst thereof, she would say, could you not have held your tongue.

I was well enough before you named her, with many such like speeches, and thus she continued long in this drowsy manuer, speaking very little all the time but that she would say sometimes that she should not be well until she came to VVarboyse, or a mile upon the way, and then she should be well. One time she asked the question whether any body in the house had slept so long as she had done, saying that it had been a long night with her, for she had then continued so five days, and if every body had slept as since had done meaning the servants of the house) why then I wonder (quoth she) howe all the work could bee done.

Upon the last day of August, she has a very sudden and sore fit presently after dinner, door she cried out very grievously to bear, that mother Samuel stood before her in a white sheet with a black Child sitting upon her shoulders, saying: look where she is, look where she is, away with your Child mother Samuel I will none of your Child, trembling every joint, and sweating marvellously, calling upon her Uncle master Pickering and others to save her from mother Samuels Child, and which such lamentable speeches because no body would help her, that it did greatly grieve those that were present. After this fit ended, her teeth were set in her head, by which means her speech also was taken from her it may bee, because she disclosed more than mother Samuel would vouchsafe to have known, after a while she greatly mourned inwardly and wept very sore, often putting her hand to her mouth, and shaked very hard. This closing of her mouth did greatly affright us all, because it could not bee that she should naturally bee preserved without the ordinary means of food, yet the often experience we had received of Gods merciful providence and care towards the Child, vanquished despair in us, yet could it not but greatly grieve even a merciless Chants hart (but that the Devil hath no mercy) to see how the Child wept and lamented, many times putting her hand to her mouth, and lifting up her head, as giving cirsting signs of an hungry desire for meat and drink.

Towards night when she should go to bed, it pleased God (whose help is always at hand, when hope was in greatest distress) that this means was found out, the Child wanted a

tooth, whereat by the halve of a quill, she sucked up some milk, and the same means received her drink. After this was done, she greatly rejoiced in countenance and outwards signs for she could not speak, but clapping her hands on her breast and belly (as it may be thought) for that she had found out a way to deceive the malice of her enemy: For the children in all their assaults, though they took the soil for a time, yet whenever it pleased God a little to ease them, though but in part yet would they greatly triumph in words if they could speak, as to say I defy thee thou wicked spirit , doe what thou can, thou can doe me no hurt, thou see that God is stronger than thou, thou art as good to let me alone, I am glad at my heart that thou can not overcome me, with many such like speeches, though in the very uttering of them, the enemy seemed to check & to torment them for it,  y straining their body, and stopuing the course of their speech, and if they could not speak, then would they rejoice in counternance, and outward signs, and this kind of triumphing after the extremity of the fit be past, is true in them all, from the eldest to the youngest.

To return to this Child, who was carried to bed in her Fit, and in time of her prayers, as she inwardly mourned than in her mind, was exceedingly tormented, yet would she not cease until she had finished them, which rule for the most part she usually kept, for thought her torments increased never so much, yet would she not long surcease her prayers, but after some release and quietness given to her of her enemy, she would go forward until she had ended them which was (no doubt) a good motion of the spirit and grace of God in the Child.

The next morning which was the first of September she was taken up in the same manner, that she lay down, her teeth still remaining fast set together, yet not so: but that she might receive milk up a quill as before.  At dinner time she had a little struggling with her Fit in the end whereof her teeth were lapped one over the other, whereas before they were set but one against the other. 

This was again a further degree of Sedans malicious enmity for now both he closed her teeth and her mouth so fast together that there is no use and help left for the quill, this fyrightful and merciless [...] of Satan with this Child had much more troubled us than it did, but that we were verily persuaded that the malice of the Devil, and of his wicked Instruments whoseuer were limited and his mischievous purpose towards the child, so [...]rre forth restrained, as that although he might endanger her health (which many times he did) yet should he never actually endammage the same, and much less her life, hereof we have had very comfortable experiences.  For oftentimes (as you may read before) she hath been so piteously racked in her body, with such sudden heavings and swellings in her belly, as if it would have broken her back or rent her [...] in sunder, such extreme neesing, and that so thick and often together after a screeching manner, filling all the house with her noise as that boude hath gushed out of her nose, and some part at her mouth.  Yet for all this when the Fit was overpassed, and she come again to her self, she hath been as one of us, cheerful in countenance, for if you had asked how she had done, she would have smile upon you: if where she had been her common answer was in a sleep or dream..  If a strong man in his perfect health had struggled in such a storm, and avid such a brunt but one hour, as she did half a day together or longer, it had been no wonder, if he had been sick a month after: No not if death it self had followed presently upon it so very strange things suffered this child.  But now she is left destitute of all outward means to relieve the body and to preserve life; because her mouth is closed up.  It was hereupon therefore thought good y oiners to make some trials and experiments (as they had oftentimes done) before in such like cases, and chiefly because the child had many times said that she should not bee well until she came to Warboyse on a mile upon the way.  She therefore accompanied with Mistress Pickering her Aunt, was taken up and carried to horseback, whereat she presently joyed much (as if she had perceined what had been done, for making signs with her hands she pointed to have the horse go on forward.

Now when she had gone almost a mile onward, thought not the direct way to Warboyse, yet the same way she came from thence to Tichmarsh grove as it feel out (for it was unknown to any in the company at that present) she began to cheer up her

self very much, and her teeth were forthwith untied: so that she said, I am not yet gone a mile, I shall straight way, and then I shall bee well.  Presently after this, when she had gone a good mile (as it may be thought) she rubben her eyes and came to her self and was very well as she said, but [...] exceedingly both show she came thither, and wherefore at the, company also, and the strangeness of teh place.  Afterwards alighting from the horse, her leg was restored to her, where of she had no use of three weeks before, and desired her Aunt to pray to God to bless her.  Thus she walked on forwards in very good and perfect estate, her.  Thus she walked on forwards in very good and perfect estate, there was meat brought for her, whereof she eat some part and drank also with good alacrity and cheerfulness.  She took a prayer book and read of it a good space, but when she came at this word Satan it troubled her fore by shaking and wringing of her shoulders.  And to see the malice of the Devil, there was no sooner mention made of her going home, but she was straight way snatched, and shaken in her shoulders, arms, and body, as it would have shuffled her together, a little after she arose, and in the very turning of her face homewardse, her eyes were shut, her legs were taken from her, her teeth fast set in her head, her belly began to heave and swell in manner as usually before when her Fit set upon her.  Now so long as she is walking forwards from the grove as it were to Warboyse, so that you speak not of going back again (for the motion only will cause her to start) she is very well and merry withouth any sign of dislike so long as either you are going on or standing still.  But so some as ever you shall turn her about to go homewards she presently sinks down in your arms as one fallen into a sudden swooned, struggling betwixt life and death, and so continues stiuing a little space until she bee clean overcome, if you in the mean time turn not her face again, which if you doe, as one awaking from sleep she is returned to her former estate.  This was proved many times at that present both on foot and on horseback in the fight of many, but in the end (there was no ram by) with great grief wee brought her back again the same way wee carried her forth: A dead child to look upon for any sense or motion, but in countenance very sweet and amiable, for in all these extremities her complexion (which naturally is faint) was no whit altered.  At night, it pleased God in despite of mischief and malice, that she received milk again by a quill in the same manner as before, yet not without some straining and straightness, because the place was closer shut than at the first: So that the child even then remained as a suckling and sucking child, for she eats no meat within the house, which is substantial and solide.  But such as passes through a quill: and if any meat bee brought unto her, she will make signs to go abroad, pointing towards that place where she is wont to awake.  The next day, therefore, after dinner, she was carried forth again, where when she came at the very self same place (as one would think within the length of a Pole) she awakened, as one coming out of a long sleep, for she would rub her eyes a little before, and gasp once or twice stretching forth her arms, and these were common fore-running signs when she came to her natural estate, there she did eat her meat very heartily with a good appetite, to the great joy of her self, and of those that were present, but when she was satisfied, and about to give thanks, then Satan appeared in his likeness, for he laboured to prohibit and hinder that good exercise, by snatching the word as it were out of her mouth, and cutting them in the half, by wringing also and twisting the parts and members of the child, in such sort, that she could not bring out one good word, & the better word, the greater was her troble to utter it.

After this done, it was thought good by some, that a little stick should be put into her mouth to keep her teeth open, whenever she was assiled again, which was tried: so that when she was turned about, (for it would not suffer her so much as to sit quietly with his face homewards, she held the stick fast in her mouth, which kept her teeth open, but she his self was as one in a dead sleep, giuning small signs of any strength, or life, and so remained until she was turned about again, which was not presently done, at that time, because wee were willing to see the issue of it.  After a little space she strove with her hands to pluck the stick out of her mouth, mourning inwardly in her mime with an heavy countenance, as if it had been much grief and trouble unto her, but she held it so fast with her teeth, that it could not (as it may be thought) without great force have been pulled out, which appeared by the great dints of her teeth, made in the stick when she was recovered.

This wee durst not adventure to doo the second time, fearing other inconveniences, for the said, when she was come to her self, that her mouth was very cold, for that the stick (as we thought) kept it open.  Howe did we tell her of a quill, by which she bled to receive her meat at home, for she asked whether she did eat meat any where else but in that place only: but it seemed very strange unto her to hear of a quill, and she knew of no such thing, neither could we bring her to believe that she could suck in a quill, for she asked many questions about it, how & which way she should doo it.

Now in the midst of this great heap, and world of wonders (as we say) appearing in this child, one thing father by the way is thought good to be remembered, which is a point wherein many men that have seen it, hardly believe their own eyes.  It is a great questions amongst us, and is not yet fully determined, whether the Child in the present time of her agony, doth sensibly feel and partake, either in anguish of mind, or grief of body, those pangs and torments which to outward judgment she doth appear to doo: it is thought she doth not, and some reasons shall be showed that may draw us to believe it.

First, the testimony of the Child her self (when she is recovered) might be sufficient to persuade hte matter, if there were nothing else, for why should not she rather by showing her grief cause us to moan and pity her (as all doth that see her) if she felt any cause why? The smiling and cheerful countenance which she hath always used, to those that ask her how she doth presently upon her fit ended, may something also strenthen this point.  The earnest desire she hath always had in time of her greatest extremities, to finish her prayers, or any such goo dexercise, although her torments (as they appeared to bee) were the more increased thereby, as usually they were.  Her exceeding hearty and immodest laughter in some of her fits, and such in deed as the Childes modesty would have blushed at, and could not have permitted, if she had been well.  To these may be added, that the not feeling of her blow and hurt, nor knowing any thing of it, until she was recovered, which she received in her fore-heade by the latch of a door, as you may read before, with many such like arguments which might be alleged.  And

not to leave out that which is of most force of all: her open contempt at all times, & in all places, both in speech & gesture, immediately before her fit took her: her boldness & good courage at all times to adventure upon it, though she knew assuredly it would assault her: as namely, in the beginning of her visitation, at the naming only of God, or Jesus, or any good word, which if you had seen, you could not have sufficiently admired: also, at the giving of thanks after or before meat received at the entering upon any good exercise, as reading or praying, she never once uses to give any sign of fear or discouragement, in any respect.  And at the naming of the devil, Mother Samuel, or any such black word, that keeps the colour, as Satan or Cicely (which is another women's name, that is suspected to be confederate in this wicked practise) she never feared nor would stick at them, but always showed her self ready (though she very well knew that she should have her fit for it) to cast her self upon the present danger.  And now here in this place which is the open fields, she is willing and forward at every motion, to turn her self about, and to set her face homewards again.  And surely it may bee thought, there are very few (though hired with great gifts) if they had but once seen the child in that pttifull plight and woeful case, wherein she hath been a hundred times, that would voluntarily cast themselves into so great an extremity and hazard of life, yca, though they and received infficient security and assured warranty both of life and health afterwards, and withal for the present time also to be without natural sense & feeling of grief, and vexation of body or mind, so full of dread and terror was this fearful spectacle, to the Standers by many times : and yet hath this little child (such is the prehemience of Gods Spirit over all spirits of wickedness) seen many of her sisters and some others, divers times in the like case, or worse (if it might be) handled and tormented.

Yet it cannot bee denied, but she hath been many times very sad in countenance, and shed some few tears a little before her fit hath come upon her: yet without any complaining at all, and of late times also: so that it may bee rather imputed (as it hath been though) to some other causes, as in part to the conceit and imagination of her cruel dealing, when she is in her fits, as it hath been reported in her hearing.  Also, for that she is deprived (for the time) of the company and fellowship of her cozens (other children in the house, whom she dearly loves) to that great sorrow and anguish of mind, which the sight of her lamentable case enforces upon others: or if there bee some other secret cause unknown unto us, for the Child her self never complains. And being demanded the case of her tears, she will auswere, sometimes that her head aketh, or that she hath some pain in one part of her body or other: But it would be too large a thing to recite one of an hundredth almost, of those memorable accidents which have befallen to this child, since the time that it first pleased God to permit her to be visited in this order.

To omit therefore what might be further said, she was carried out of the fields back again into the grove, being more like the Image and Shadow of a child, then so in deed, continuing in the same estate and order at home as abroad, not eating any thing but such melthing meats as would posse through a quill, only sometimes she would take some buttered meats, very small minced, & rub it against the outside of her teeth, & so suck in the juice and moisture of it.  From this day, which was the 3. of September, until Tuesday, which was the 8. of the same month, was she carried abroad into the field every day to eat her meat, where she failed not to awake at teh very self same place, & not before: And to persuade you that she would come to her self in no other place but in that only, she hath been carried a more direct way to Warbois, two or three miles upon the way, but to small purpose, for she continued in the same estate.  Upon this tuesday was she carried from Tichemarsh grove, to Warbois to her fathers house, where by the way in the fields, at a dhege corner, which was the ordinary place, she made the common signs, & presently awaked continuing all the way in very healthful sort and merry, only her greatest care and grief was, that she was departed from Tichemarshe grove.

Now that you have heard the particular manner of the fits of this child, Mistress Elizabeth, you may imagine & aim at the manner of handling of the rest of her sisters, during this time, remaining in other places, who were no less strangely dealt withal

than she was, of whom if it should be particularly be observed, as is done in her, just as strange wonders (if any thing hitherto seem strange) befell every one of them severally, as are these, which you have already heard. And by some of them were showed matters of far greater admiration but this may suffice, least in entrnig into the rest, no end could be found, so infinite is the matter.

It pleased the providence of God, that not long after Master Gilbert Pickering had carried away this child to his house, about a month or such a thing, the Lady Cromwell, wife of Sir Henry Cromwell, Knight, (who then lay in Ramsay, a town two miles distant from Warboyse) came to Master Throckmortons house, together with her daughter in law, Mistress Cromwell, to visit these children & to comfort their parents, with who she was well acquainted: she had not long staid in the house, but the children which were there, fell all into their fits, & were so grievously tormented for the time, y it pitied that good Ladies hart to see them, in so much, that she could not abstain from tears, whereupon, she caused the old woman, mother Samuel to be sent for, who durst  not deny to come, because her husband was tenant to Sir Henry Cromwell, who after she was come, y the children grew to be worse than they were before, which caused the greater sorrow. Then the Lady Cromwell took Mother Samuel aside, and charged her deeply with this witchcraft, using also some hard speeches to her. But she strngly denied them all, saying, that master Trockmorton and his wife did her great wrong, so to blame her without cause. The Lady answered her, that neither Master Throckmorton nor his wife accused her, but the children themselves did it in their fits did it, or rather the spirit by them.

One of them, Mistress Ione by name, being then in her fit, hearing the old woman thus clearing her self (for she heard not the Lady nor any other) said, that it was she that caused all this, and something there is saith she, that doth now tell me so: asking if no body heard it but she, affirming that it squealed very loud in her ears, & mervailed that no body could hear it, wishing the old woman to listen to it. But mother Samuel still continued her denial. Then the Lady Cromwell would have taken her up into a chamber, to have examined her more narrowly, (Master Doctor Hall, a Doctor of divinity being present) but she by no means

would go with the, but rather feigned many excuses to go home. In the end, when the Lady perceived, that by no good speeches, neither she, nor any other could prevail with her, & that fain she would have bin gone, she suddenly pulled of her kercher, & taking a pair of shears, clipped of a locke of her hair, & gave it privily to Mistress Throckmorton, Mother of y children, together with her Hairlace, willing her to burn them. Mother Samuel perceiving her self thus dealt withal, spake to the Lady thus. Madame why doe use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet.'  These words were afterwards remembered, & were not at that present time taken hold of by any. Towards night the Lady departing, left the children much what as she found them.

The same night, after the Lady Cromwell departed fro Warboyse, she suffered many things in her dream concerning mother Samuel, & she was very strangely tormented in her sleep, by a cat (as she imagined) which mother Samuel had sent unto her, which cat offered to pulcke of all the skin and flesh from her arms & body, but such was the struggling and striving of the Lady that night in her bed, & mournfu noise, which she made speaking to the cat, and to mother Samuel that she wakened her bedfellow, who was Mistress Cromwell, before named, wife to the worshipfall Master Oliuer Cromwell, son & heir to sir Henry Cromwell, who that night was fro home. Mistress Cromwell being awakened, and perceiving y Lady thus disquieted, awakened her also, who greatly thanked her for it, declaring how she had bin troubled in her dream, with mother Samuel and her cat, with many other circumstances, which she did very well remember, neither could she take any quiet rest or sleep all that night after, for fear thereof. Not long after, the Lady fell very strangely sick, & so continued unto hey dying day, which was some year & quarter after her being at Warboyse.  The manner of her fits was much like the childrens, save only that she had always her perfect senses: for sometime her pain would be in one arm, sometime in the other: now in the one leg, by & by in the other, many times in her head: yea, sometimes it would take her but in one several finger or toe, and always shake the grieved part, as if it had been the palsy. And that saying of mother Samuel (which she used to her at Warboise, which was, Madam, I never hurt you as yet) would never

out of her mind. And thus leaving this good Lady in heaven with God, we will return to these children.

About Christmas after, Anno 1590 (for there was nothing noted all y time, although there befell 100. wonders) master Henry Pickering, uncle to these children, being then a Scholar of Cambridge, went to Master Throckmortons house, & continued there some 3. or 4. days, was desirous to speak with mother Samuel, & taking a convenient time, he requested 2. other scholars of his acquaintance (then being in the town) to go with him, to who they granted, & presently went without the knowledge of any in Master Throckmortons house. As they were going, she came out of her own house, & crossed y street before them: when they saw her, they determined rather to follow her whither she went, than stay her return, because her husband was a froward man, & wold not suffer her to talk with any, if he might know it. She went to a neighbours house for some Barm, & carried a little wooden tankard in her hand, & a little Barley in her lap, to exchange for the Barm: when she came to the house, to whither she purposed to go, the scholars followed her immediately, & heard her tel her errand to the wife of y house, who had not that for which she came. Being ready to depart, the Scholars desired to speak with her, but she seemed loath to stay, yet they entering into questions with her, stayed her a little.  But she was very loud in her answers, & impatient, not suffering any to speak, but her self, one of them desired her to keep the women's virtue, & be more silent: she answered, that she was born in a mill, begot in a kill, she must have her will, she could speak no more softlier. The greatest part of her speech, was railing words against Ma. Throckmorton & his children, saying, that he did misuse her, in suffering his children so to play the wantons in accusing of her, & bringing her name into question, often repeating, that the childrens fits was nothing but wantonness in them, & if they were her children, she would not suffer the so to escape without punishment, one after the other. The scholars enquired about her service of God, and profession of her faith. But al y they could get of her, was, that her God would deliver her, her God would defend her, and revenge her of her enemy, always using the phrase of my God will doo this & that for me: which being noted by one of them, he asked her if she had a God, alone, or if she did not serve the same God that others did'? She answered, yes that she did: yet much ado they had to bring her from the phrase of my God, to say the God of heaven & earth. In the end she would needs be gone, saying, that her husband would beat her for her long tarrying. Then the uncle of those children, being somewhat more moved than the rest, at the parting said, that if she were the woman that had wrought this wickedness upon these children, the vengeance of God would surely wait upon her unto death, & howsoever she might deceive her self, & she would for a time, yet there was no way to prevent the judgements of God, but by her confession & repentance: which if she did not in time, he hoped one day to see her burned at a stake, and he himself would bring fire & wood, & the children should blow the coals. Her answer to him was this, (for they were then in the street hard by a pond) I had rather (said she) see you dowsed over head and ears in this pond, and so they parted.

Now to come to the point, the eldest of Master Throckmortons daughters was then in her fit, sitting at home in a Parlour, her father and Grandmother, with some other of her sisters in their fits being present with her.  On the sudden (said she) now is my uncle (naming him) and the two other (whom also she named) going to mother Samuel. We shall hear some news by and by. Presently she said, look where mother Samuel goes trotting in the streets before them, with a wooden tankard in her hand, and her Apron is tucked up before her, I believe saith she there is somewhat in it. She is gone into such a mans house that keeps an Alehouse, the mans name she could not hit of, but described him by his read head. Hark, said she

to her sisters, mother Samuel is very loud, and my uncle bids her speak softly, but she saith she cannot, repeating to her father and the rest, the same words, (viz. that she was borne in a mill, &c.) after the same manner that mother Samuel spake them to her uncle, and the other Scholars. To bee short, she declared particularly every word that passed between mother Samuel and those Scholars at that time. And at the parting she said, there Mother Samuel my Uncle did touch you I think, repeating again the very same words that her Uncle had done, wishing that that day were once come, for I mys elf (said she) would
blow the coals.' But he had been as good as if he had said nothing to her (said she) for she wished him over head & ears in the pond for it. Master Throckmorton standing by & hearing all this, after that the child had said, that now mother Samuel and the scholars were parted, enquired of his brother, the child's uncle, asking if any one knew whither he was gone. Answer was made, that he had not came home fro the Church since evening Prayer, (for it was on a Saturday) but where he was no body knew. It may be (said Master Throckmorton) that he is with mother Samue, & went immediately out of his own house, to see if he could perceive where they were. As he went he met them in the Church yard coming from mother Samuels. Where have you bin said he? They told him. I could have told you as much my self, said he: & repeated to them the whole matter, as his daughter before had showed. When they were come into y Parlour where she was, there was also another of her sisters in her fit sitting by. And this her other sister could hear her said uncle speak unto her, & no body else, and so by her mouth, (for they could for the most part hear one another in their fits) he enquired of her sister all those matters over again, which she did in his own hearing repeat. But said she, the wind was so great that I had much ado to hear them, whereas indeed there was then no wind stirring. After this the spirit (or the thing, as the children called it) would many times appear unto them in their fits in some kind of shape or other, but most commonly in the likeness of a dun chicken, & would talk familiarly with them, saying that they came from mother Samuel, (whom they called their dame) and were sent by her to the children to torment and vex them in that sort. It would declare to the children many things concerning mother Samuel, insomuch that she could doo almost nothing at home for a great time, but the spirit would disclose, if it were required by the children in their fits: viz. asto know what she was then in doing at home, or in what place of her house, or else where she was, the spirit would tell: which (by a Messenger presently sent of purpose) was proved true.

Now the spirits manifestly began to accuse Mother Samuel to the children in their fits, saying: it was she that had bewitched them, and all those servants which were bewitched in the house and told them, that whenever they were in their fits, and were either carried to Mother Samuels house, or she caused to come to them, they should be presentl well.  This many times was proved true, & never failed once: so that if the children at any time being in theifts, had been carried to mother Samuels house, (for it was a very hard thing to get mother Samuel to Ma. Throckmortons house) althought they were in such a case, as y a strong man could scarcely hold them (they would so struggle, start, and sprawl in his arms) yet if they came but once to the threshold of M. Samuels door, they would wipe their eyes, and say, I am well, why doo you carry me, set me down, as though some shame had been offered them, in that tehy were carried in the streets, not knowing any thing in what case they had been.  While they continued in the house, they were very well, but dtermining once to come away, and offering to come out of the door, they fell presently down on the ground, & were brought from thence in the same case that they were carried thither: contrariwise, whenever Mo. Samuel came to Ma. Throckmortons house, in what kind of extremity soever these children were in, (as it was most wonderful strange to see them many times) so soon as ever she had set foot into the Parlour or Hal where they were, they wold all presently start up upon their feet, and be as well as any in the house, and so continue while she was present.  But when she offered to depart, they would all sink down as a stone upon the ground: if she turned but her face again & came towards them, they would be well as before, which was tried rr. times in one hour.  And when she departed fro the house, she left them in the same estate wherein she found them, so long as their fit continued upon them.  After this, Ma. Throckmorton thought good to disperse his children, & sent them abroad, some to one friends house, some to another for a time, to see how they should be dealt withal, yet always keeping some one of them at home with him.

If it should be declared how these were al severally handled for the time they were abroad, it would ask a long discourse, & longer indeed the is thought meet at this time, although very strange things, and such as may seem worth the noting befell every one of them, as this for one: They could tell being in their fits, in what case or estate their other sisters were at that instant, being


separated some of them 8. 10. or 12. miles a sunder, I have said, now is my sister, naming her & the place where she was in her fit very sore handled, as she herself also was at that instant.  It was proved to be most true by the ijst computation of times, with many such like things.

But this may suffice concerning them being abroad, that they were never altogether clear and free from their fits, although it be true that some of them, whither at home or abroad, had not their fits above once in a month, sometimes once in half a year, and one of them was clear a whole year together.  And this also is verified & true in some of these 5. sisters, that they were never clear nor free from some kind of fit or other, three weeks together: I think scarcely three days since the first day it took them, except now since these last Assizes in Lent, whereat these Witches were executed.

To posse over all that which might be spoken of them for a year and almost an half, we will come nearer unto these latter times, wherein the spirits, whither moved by their own malice, (as it passes the reach of man to sound the depth of the denils malice to mankind) or moved by the malice of the senders, and letters on, or both: it is not known, or whether for the conclusion and consummation of their parents patience in this point: It pleased the wisdom of God, who in his providence had determined their end, to grant them, therefore more liberty for the time, to exercise their malice against these children, we leave it to God, but truth it is, that they were more strangely vexed, & more grievously tormented in their body now of late, & take them generally altogether, then at any time almost from the beginning.

And to begin this time at Michelmasse last past, or thereabouts, four of these children were altogether at Warboyse, in their Fathers house, and the fifth, which was the eldest of them, was at her Uncles house, Gilbert Pikering, Esquire, dwelling at Tichemarshe grove.

About this time, which was Michelmas 1592. one of these four children, the youngest save one, near upon the age of fourteen years, was in a very strange kind of fit, the manner whereof was as follows: Every day for the space of three weeks or more, she had a senseless fit, some one of the day or other,

and sometimes many fits in one day.  In which fit she could neither hear, see, nor speak to any body, besides, her inward griefs, that she would heave and start, and swell uppe her body, which was very troublesome to her for the time.  When she was out of these fits, she would go up & down the house very well, she wold eat & drink, and sometimes be very pleasant in outward gesture with her sisters, she doo any thing, which by any sign she did understand should be done, she wold make a reverence as she passed by, unto those where she saw it was due: in so much that any man ignorant of her estate, could perceive nothing to be amiss in her, yet wold she never speak to any in particular, neither could she hear any y spake to her during that time: except sometimes she wold prattle a little to an infant, which was newly borne in the house, wherein she took great delight.

It pleased God, about the beginning of these kind of fits in her, an Aunt of hers being then in y house, was delivered of a child, upon which occasion, many of her uncles & aunts and other kindred and friends, resorted to the house, and some of them stayed a week or ten days together, all which time the child was in these kide of fits: and as it happened, Ma. Samuel amongst the rest came to the house, and was brought up into the gentlewoman's chamber, where commonly the greatest company was: so soon as she came in, (this child in question) being there, espied her, and presently spake to her, bidding her welcome, & saying that she was a great stranger there, she fetched her up both meat and drink, and wold do any thing readily that she willed her to do.  In the end, she asked Mo. Samuel, whose that little child was which she herself had in her arms? the old woman told her, and likewise the name of it, which thing she also demanded: the child mervailed, saying, Is my aunt then brought to bed? I am very glad of it: why then (saith she) such and such of mine, uncles and aunts promised to be here, who were then indeed in the house, and some of them in that company.  Then Mo. Samuel told her, that such & such whom she asked for, were in presence.  The child said, that she saw no body but her and that little child, which she had in her arms, although she looked full in their faces.  Many such like strange things the fell out, which is too long to speak of.  When the old woman departed, the child lost the use of all her

senses, and continued in the same case, wherein she was when the old woman came into the house.

When she had continued thus 3. weeks or more, she came one day out of her Aunts chamber into the hall, and she had not long stayed there, but she fell into a most troublesome fit for the time, but it continued not long, presently she spake and said: I am glad, and very glad, repeating it often, on the sudden she wiped her eyes, and came out of her fit.  Her mother being in the Hall, she asked her blessing, and enquired of many things, and amongst others, asked how her Aunt did, from whom a little before she came, and knew of nothing that was done, neither that any company had been there for the space of 2. weeks before.

It follows to speak of the rest of her sisters together with herself, [...] all of them, as the year grew towards an end, so their griefs and extremity of troubles increased: insomuch, that every day brought with it increase of payne, and strangeness in their manner of fits.

Towards Hollantide, the spirits grew very familiar with the children, and commonly towards the end of their fits, when the greatest trouble was over, wold talk with them, half an hour together, & sometimes longer: The greatest matter of their talk, was about their manner of fits which they should have, & concerning Mo. Samuel, whose pleasure it was that they should be so used, but the spirits said many times, that they would bring her to shame for it in the end.  If in this time (being in their fits) they had enquired of their spirit, when they should come out of that fit, wherein then they were, and when they should have another, it would have told them, and not missed any whit at all.

If they had asked how many fits they should have the next day following, and the third day, or any day that work, and how many fits they should have in one day, and what manner of fits they should be, whither more grievous or less, howe long every fit should continue, and in what part of the day they should begin, and when they should end, it hath told them, and not failed in any one point, for it hath been presently set down in writing, as the children have spoken it, (for it was not possible to remember the times for them all) and proved wholly true.


The times and singes, which the spirits did appoint unto the, for the beginning or ending of their fits, were usually these.  In the morning so soon as they did offer to arise out of their beds, so some as they were up or ready: so soon as they asked their Father blessing, or their Mother, or their Grandmother: so soon as they took a hook in hand to pray, or when they had ended their prayers: so soon as they went to breakfast, so soon as Dinner was set upon the board: or so soon as they did offer to say grace either before or after dinner & so some as they themselves were set down to dinner, or at the first bit of meat they put in their mouths: or so soon as dinner, was ended, or they had put up their knife after dinner: the same circumstances at Supper also observed.  Or if it had been upon the Sabboth day, or any day wherein the belles ought to be rung: so soon as the first, second, or third peal ringeth, or have done ringing, with many such like signs, which would bee too long to speak of: appointed by the spirit for the children to fall in or out of their fits, which they duly observed & failed not a minute, as may be thought.

After they had continued in this case about a month together or such a thing, whether the spirits were weary, (as they oftentimes said unto the children in their fits, that they now waxed weary of their Dame Mo. Samuel) or whether y through the power of gods goodness, and special protection of they children, the spirits perceived, that their own malice, & the malice of their Dame to the children was restrained and kept under in such sort, that they could not kill the children as they desired: for wee may not think, that it agrees with the nature of the evil spirit to sport and play with man, as these spirits oftentimes did with these little children: they said to them, that now ere long, they wold bring their Dame either to her confession or confusion.  And this was the greates stay of comfort & prop of patience which the parents of these children & friends always had: namely, that when these children were in their greatest torment and miseries as might be devised, in such sort as that it made the hart of the beholders many times to met in their bodies, being without all hope ever in this world to see them alive again, yet whenever it pleased God to deliver them out of their fits, they

would wipe their eyes and bee presently well, as if it had never been they, not knowing any thing that had befallen them, so that now it should seem that God himself wold take the matter into his own hands, & having in his counsel determined an end thereof, so he would also appoint the means to bring it to posse, which was even by the spirits themselves, the instruments of this wickedness.  For now they began to accuse Mo. Samuel, openly to her face, & say y they shall not be well in any place, excpe they continue in her house, or she be brought to continue with them: and besides that, they shall have more troublesome fits than ever they had, except one of those two be brought to posse.

Mo. Throckmorton still thinking that the spirits might lye, was contended to try the uttermost to three weeks togeher, all which time his children had very many most grievous and troublesome fits: insomuch that when night came, there was never a one of them able to go to their beds alone, their legs were so full of pain and sores, besides many other griefs they had in their body (being out of their fits) which was not usual with them: and one of them also for all that time of 3. weeks, never had use of her legs, except it were an hour or two in one day, why Mother Samuel was in the house, and then she was able to go, and was very well, as the rest also were: otherwise her legs were thrust uppe to her body as if they had been tied with strings, and where you set her down, there you should find her, except she crept away.

Master Throckmorton, perceiving that by means he could get leave of old Iohn Samuel, for the old woman to come to his house, although he offered very largely for it, which was, to allow him if it came to ten pounds in the year for the board and wages, of the best servant in Huntington-shyre to doo his business (if he would) in her stead, besides his promise & bond, if he would require it, for the well using of his wife while she was with him, he could find no other remedy for the health of his children, but to carry them thither: which he did, who so soon as they came into the house, were all presently well, which he perceiuin, said, that his children should dwell there, & out of the house they should not go, he would provide for their necessities.  The man seeing this, that there was no striving with

the company, quenched out of the fire, and it was a cold season, saying that he would starve them, besides very many evil words, which came from him and his daughter at that time.  All that day they continued there very well, and did both eat and drink, and read in their book, and were very merry.  At night when the man Iohn Samuel perceived that they should lodge there, he thought that they would be very troublesome to him, and therefore gave his faithful promise, that his wife should come to Ma. Thorckmortons house the next morning, & continue with him: whereupon Ma. Throckmorton took home his children, & they were in their fits so soon as they came out of his doors, and so continued all that night.  The next morning Ma. Thrackmorton went for the old woman, but she was gone no body knew whither, so he sent again for his children, who so soon as they came into the house, were well.  Towards night, came in the old woman, who said that she had been 2. or 3. miles out of y town, and her husband know of her going, because she should not come to Ma. Throckmortons, which when he understood that she had spoken, (for she spake it privately, desiring them to whom she spake it, not to tell her husband) he utterly forswore the matter, and presently fell upon his wife, and beat her very sore with a cudgel many being present, before she could be rescued by them.  In the end, when the man perceived Ma. Throckmorton still to continue in the same mind aforesaid, he was contended to let his wife go home with the that night, who went all to Ma. Throckmortons house very well together, & so continued the space of nine or ten days following, without any manner of soreness, lameness, or any manner grudging of fits, and in better care, then they had been (as it was well known) all of them together, for the space of three whole years before.  This made the parents right glad, and to use the woman as a welcome guest.  At the ten days end, the old Woman entreated Mistress Throckmorton, for her husband was gone forth that morning, that she might go home, making her excuse to fetch something that she wanted.  Mistress Throckmorton was very loath to grant it, promising that she her self wold rather fetch what she would have, then that she shod go out of her house: yet the old woman, saying that no body could come by that thing that she wold have, but herself (which happily was true) and promising her present return, she yielded to her request.

Soon after she was gone, some of the children fell into their fits again as before times, & the spirit then talking with them, said.  That now Mo. Samuel was feeding her spirits, & making a new league and composition with them, which was, that although now she came again to the house, they shall be no whit the better, but rather the worse for her being there, because she would not remain any longer there: which thing seemed to bee true that the child spake, for so soon as she came again (which was not before she was sent for 4. or 5. hours after she went) the children which were in their fits at her coming, so continued, and they that were not after her coming, fell into their fits, all of them crying out that now Mo. Samuel had made a new composition with her spirits, and now they should be no white better for her presence, but rather the worse.

Master Throckmorton when he came home, and perceiving the case otherwise with his children then he left it, and the cause why, could not be but heartily sorry: yet referred all to the good pleasure of GOD, and would not suffer the old woman to depart his house, for this cause chiefly, because his children being in their fits, could neither hear, see, nor speak to any body, but to her, & some of the children could take nothing, but that which she either gave them, or touched with her hands.

Mother Samuel remaining thus with the children, she could not be in any place of the house alone, neither doing any thing about the house, but the children in their gets wold reveal it, specially when she was feeding of her spirits, for then the children would say: now is Mother Samuel in such a place of the house feeding of her spirits: when they went and looked, there they should find her, but whether doing any such thing or not, God and her conscience are the best witnesses.

Many times also as she sate talking with these children, being in their fits by the fire side, they would say unto her: Look you here Mo. Samuel, doo not you see this thing that sits here by us? she would answer no, not she: why they wold say again, I marvel that you doo not see it, look how it leaps, skyppeth, and plays uppe and down: pointing at it with their fingers


here & there as it leaped. Sometimes also they would say, Hark Mo. Samuel, how you not hear it? hark how loud it is, I marvel you doo not hear it, nay you cannot but hear it.  She wold deny it, and bid them ask their father, or some other whom she saw to stand by, whether they heard it or not.  The children wold answer, that they saw no body although thtey stood hard by the.  Then would they tell Mo. Samuel, that it tells them, that she both hears it, sees it, and sent it.  The father these children, Ma. Throckmorton, to make a kind of experience of this matter, one night willed Mo. Samuel, that it tells them, that she both hears it, sees it, and sent it.  The father of these children, Ma. Throckmorton, to make a kind of experience of this matter, one night willed Mo. Samuel (as he might have done to any other then being present) to name howe many fits those three children that then were in their fits, should have the next day following, and what kind of fits they should have, when they should being, and how long they should continue.  Mo. Samuel, was very loath to be brought unto it: yet in the end, their father saying that she should doe it.  she said, one of them shall aue three fits, naming the child, such & such for the manner, namely easy fits, appointing the time for their beginnings and endings: th eother shall have none, but be well all the day.  All which fits, proved very instly in every one of them the next day, as she had spoken.

At an other time not long after, Mo. Samuel sitting by these children being in their fits as before, Ma. Throckmorton their father, and some other also being with him, demanded of Mo. Samuel, saying, that he had heard, that those that were acquainted with these spirits (as the children say that she is) and had retained them in their service, to doo for them as they commanded, that they did feed them, and reward them with some thing from them, but most usually with their blood, and that every day: now therefore (said he) make open confession, & shame the devil in telling the truth, whether you doo any such thing or not.

She most vehemently denied it, with many bitter words and curses upon her self, desiring the Lord, to show some present token from heaven upon her, that all the world might know, that she was such a kind of woman, as they suspected her for, if she used any such thing, or rewarded them any such way, or had any spirits, or knew what they were.

Presently after, Master Throckmorton, and Master Henry Pickering, uncle to the said children, who was then with him, hearing her use such protestations, being half terrified in her harts, (because they always vehemently suspected her giltinesse) that she should thus violently with her own hands (as it were) pull down the judgments of God upon her head, went out of the doors, and before they were gone ten paces from the house, another young Gentleman, Master Iohn Lawrence (cozen to the said children) that stayed behind in the Parlour, came to Master Throckmorton, and Ma: Henry Pickering, & said that mother Samuels chin did bleed: whereupon they returned into the Parlour again where she was, and saw the napkin where with she had wiped away the blood from her chin, to be bloody to the quantity of eight or ten drops.  Then Ma. Throckmorton, with the rest looked upon her chin, and there was no more to be seen than upon the back of a clean hand, only there appeared some few little red spots, as if they had been flea-bytings.  Then Master Throckmorton demanded of her, whether her chin used to bleed so or not: She said, that it did very often.  He asked her, who could witness it but her self?  She said no body, for it did always bleed when she was alone, and she never told any body of it.

This her bleeding at the chin, she did confess to the said Master Henry Pickering, after she was condemned, that the spirits were then sucking at her chin, when she made that protestation to Master Throckmorton and him, and that when she wiped them of with her hand, her chin bled, which sometimes it had done before, after their sucking, but not often, and never so much as then, nay scarcely the quantity of one drop at any time before.

And this by the way, as a general note throughout the Book, where there is one of these strange things set down (if they bee so accounted as strange) there are ten omitted, which may as well bee put in, and (in the judgment of them that hear of them) are no less strange than these: And for that which this Book doth contain, it is set down upon the sudden, and as it comes to present memory, at the request of

of divers Right Worshipful, and especially for the motion sake of the Right Worshpfull, Master Justice Fenner, one of the Patrons hereof.  And for the truth of the most of these things herein contained, they were given in evidence, and ready to bee given against the parties accused, if either need should have required or time served, upon the oath of divers Gentlemen on the Assizes day at Huntington, before the said parties: And for the rest which were not then alleged, if any shall made doubt thereof, there are divers Gentleman, of honest report, ready to confirm the same auppon their oaths, if need should so require, that were present, some at one time, and some at another, at all these several Tragedies, (as they may be termed.)

At another time, soon after, the spirits told the children (then being in their fits, the old woman also standing by them) that if their Father Master Throckmorton would then presently go to Iohn Samuells house, his daughter Agnes Samuel, who then dwelt at home with her father, and is not yet brought into question about any of these matters, would hide her self, and not be seen of him.  Master Throckmorton hearing them, said, that he would go presently and make trial thereof.  When he came to the house, Agnes Samuel, whether perceiving Ma: Throckmorton, or any of his company, or what so ever else it was, it is not known, but she went up into the Chamber (there being but one in the house) she stayres whereof stood in the same Parlour below where her father was, and the door thereof was a trappe door: where-upon she set sackes of corn, and tubbs with some such like things, to keep it down.  Master Throckmorton hearing a noise in the house throught there was some such matter in hand, & continued still knocking at the door.  Presently Iohn Samuel asked who was there, and what he would, with some such like questions, and in the end, knowing what he was, said he should not come in; Then Master Throckmorton when on the other side of the house, and finding the back door open, went in, and when he came into the Parlour where the man was in his bed, being about eight of the clock or something before, he asked for Agnes Samuel, his daughter, and where she was, Iohn Samuel had not his oath to seek, 

but presently swore as God judge his soul (which was his common oath, and used also divers times before the Bench at his arraignment, yea, and until the very time of his execution) that he knew not where she was. 

Ma. Throckmorton asked when he saw her? He answered, that since the evening she was in the house, but where now she is, he could not tell.  He asked if she was not in the chamber over them, he swore he could not tel, which thing he could not (indeed) but know, for it was a very low chamber, and she could not stir her foot in it, but he must needs hear her: besides, her going up into it, for the stayres stood hard at his beds feet, and the noise also she made in the hearing of Ma. Throckmorton and the rest coming into the house.  Ma. Throckmorton verily suspecting that she was there, called to her three or 4. times and willed her to answer if she was there, for it was all that he desired, to know where she was, but she would not answer: Then Ma. Throckmorton took the candle, and said he would go up and see, but when he came to the top of the stairs, the trap door was so fast, that he could not stir it, which he perceiving, said, that surely eh wold break open the door, or break up the plancher of the chamber, for he would go into it before he went out of the house, and willed one of the company to fetch him a bar of iron or some such like thing, for he would doe it indeed.

The Maid hearing Ma. Throckmorton thus resolute, answered that she was there: then Ma. Throckmorton willed her to come down: which she did, remooving those things that before she had set upon the door, so he departed home to his house, challenging the man for his naughty lye, which yet hes  stiflie stood in.  But to let an hundred of these things posse with their fellows, and to come nearer the old women's confession, and the manner of it: you shall understand, that mother Samuel grew now to be mervailous weary of Master Throckmortons house, both because she could doo nothing in the house, but the children in their fits would reveal it, and especially, because the children in their fits, likewise had told her twenty times, to her face, that she should confess this matter before the Tuesday after Twelve day, and that the spirits had told them, that they would


enforce her to confess it in despite of her, and she had often experience, that whatsoever the spirits foretold, proved most true.

Now this Tuesday which the children so often named, was not then thought upon (of any that heard it) to be the Sessions day at Huntington, as it is generally in most places of England, no not within a week or more after the children had spoken of it: yet were they often whispering with themselves (always in their fits as you must understand it) about that Tuesday, wishing oftentimes, that it were once come, for y was some happy day (they would say) belike for them, for after that day the spirits had told them, they should never have more fits : so that all their joy in their fits, was for that day, yet they would say to themselves, that the spirits doth tell them, that it may happily be before that Tuesday: but on y Tuesday at the farthest she must confess it, and they must be well, but if she would confess it before, they should be well prsently whenever she did confess it.

For this cause the children in their fits continually would exhort her to confess it, that they might be well, which yet she always would deny to doo, saying: that she wold not confess that which she never did know of, nor consented unto: the children would answer, that they would not wish her to accuse herself for any thing, and therefore willed her to look ot that in any respect, yet they said, that they enforced no more upon her, then what the spirits had told them.  Yet to speak the truth of these children and no more, if any thing herein written of them be strange, this for strangeness goes beyond all other, and for truth equal to the rest: such were the heavenly & divine speeches of these children in their fits, to this old woman, some at one time, some at another, concerning her confession of thy fact, as that if a man had heard it, he would not have thought himself better edified at ten Sermons.

The matter of their speech was this, concerning chiefly the joys of heaven which she should loose: and the torments of hell which she should endure, if she being guilty would not yet confess, and the eschewing of the one and enjoying of the other, if she would confess and be sorry for that she had done: they rehearsed likewise unto her, her naughty manner of living, her

usual cursing and banning of all that displeased her, and especially of their parents, and of them: (which she could not deny) her negligent coming to Church, and slackness in Gods service, all which she confessed to them, but she would now begin to ammende she said, Her lewd bringing up of her Daughter, in suffering her to her Dame, both in controlling of her, and beating of her, which before had been proved to her face, & she herself had also confessed.  They remembered also unto her, that which they had heard some speak of, when they were out of their fits: namely, that she had said, that their fits were but wantonness in them: they asked her now, whether she was still of that mind or not: She answered no: with many such like speeches, and in the end, concluded with their hearty prayer to God for her, saying that they would forgive her from bottom of their hart, if she wold confess it that they might be well, besides that, that they would entreat their parents and their friends (so much as in them lay) clearly to forgive and forget all that was past.  Their manner of behaviour in this their exhortation to her was, that as for the most part they began with tears, so they continued, and always ended with tears: insomuch that there was not any y heard them, could abstain fro weeping, only the old woman was little or nothing moved.

This kind of behaviour in the children, passed or until nearer Christmas, yet without any touch or stirring of the old woman, in the mean season every day almost, this old woman had a fit of bleeding at the nose, and bled very much at a time (which is not usual in old age) so that now she wared faint, and looked very pale, insomuch, that Master Throckmorton and his wife, were very careful for her, fearing some harm should come unto her in his house: and comforted her by all the means they could, not suffereing her to want any thing that she desired, if possibly they could come by it: so that she did confess to all that came to her, that she was mervailous well used of Master Throckmorton, and thought herself greatly bound to him, as truly she had no other cause.

For as for her business, she did nothing, but her own work, and for her diet, she sat at his own board, or with his children, if they were in their fits, and could not sit down, and for her


lodging she lay continually in his own Chamber and for the most part with one of his children.

And to tell you one thing more of her before her confession, one of thee Children, Mistress Elizabeth Throckmorton, was one day not well at ease, and could not eat any meat: yet when night came and supper was ready, she thought to make her self amends: but when she was ready to sit at the Table, she fell presently into her fit, and yet that was not all the punishment she had, but her mouth was locked uppe, that she could neither eat, drink, nor speak, as it was an usual thing with them all, to have their mouths shut uppe, especially at meal times, and other while shut and open, half a dozen times in a dinner, so would the spirits sport with them: but she went so to bed, very sorrowful and weeping, what her grief was, none can tell, because she was not able to utter it: when the next day came, she was sick and ill, as the day before, (yet out of her fit) and eat very little or nothing at all, when night came she said she felt her self well amended, and very hungry: not knowing for her part, but that she had eaten her supper the night before.

Then was she counselled by them that feared the worst, to eat something, but she said she would not, purposing to eat her part at supper, when the time came, and meat was set upon the board, she fell into the same case as she had been in the night before, which Master Throckmorton perceiving, he said to the old woman that stood by her.  I think (Mother Samuel) you are disposed to pine that wench.  She made him answer no, she was rather sorry to see it.  Well said he, surely you shall neither eat nor drink, until she canne doo both, and therefore (said Master Throckmorton) whilst she fasteth, you shall fast, and when she can eat, you shall eat, but not before, use the matter as you will.  And thus they continued both fasting, until Supper was almost ended, and the company ready to arise: the one fasting upon necessity, because she could not eat, and the other for Master Throckmortons pleasure, because she might not.

The old woman perceiuning that Ma. Throckmorton was in good earnest with her, & that the meat was carried out of y Parlour: On

Image 27 containing page [50]

On the sudden, upon what motion GOD he knows, the child fetched a great sigh, for she had been weeping all Supper time, and spake, saying, If I had some meat now, I could eat it.

Mistress Throckmorton (the childes Mother) hearing her speak, as did also all the rest that were in the Parlour, commanded presently that meat should be given to them both, the company not giving notice to Mother Samuel of the matter: so they both fell to themeate very heartily, but especially the old Woman, who as it should seem, was then very hungry, (as she had always a good stomach) and from that time forwards, during the old women's continuing in the house, neither that child, nor any of her sisters, had their mouths shut up, at any time when they should eat their meat, or if they were, they did not long continue so.  Although it was a common custom with them before time, to have gone supperless to bed upon that very occasion, many a time.

After all these matters were passed over, and as it wared every day nearer and nearer to the time appointed, Mo. Samuel every day complained of a new grief to befall her, sometimes she would cry out of her back, that it was so full of pain, that she was not able to stir herself in her bed all the day long, nor take any rest at night.

Sometimes she would in like sort cry out of her head, otherwhiles of her stomach: yet she would eat her meat, saying that she had a gnawing at her hart, and the next day after, it would be in her knee, or lower, so that she would go halting up and down the house.  And to speak the truth of her, it should seem that something there was that troubled her, whatsoever it was, for she would so groan, and moan herself in the night time, one while complaining of this part of her body, another while of that, that indeed she rested but little in the night time herself, and greatly disquieted those also that lay in the Chamber by her.

And one night amongst all the rest, she cried out very pitifully of her belly, insomuch, that she disturbed and awakened both Ma. Throckmorton and his wife, that lay by her, saith Master Throckmorton.  In Gods name Mo. Samuel, what ails you and why do you groan so? said she, I have a marvellous great pain in my belly on the sudden, and I know not how it should be caused.  Why said he, what is the matter in your belly?  She answered, that there was something in it, which as she thought stirred, and it was as big as a penny loaf: and put her to marvelous pain: whereupon Mistress Throgmorton arose out of her bed, and went and felt upon her belly, and there was indeed a marvelous swelling to the quantity before likened, but she felt it not stir, not staying long with her, the weather was so cold, and be it spoken without offence to women, it may be that she bred then that child, wherewithal she said she was when she was asked what she could say (by my Lord the Judge, why sentence of death should not be given against her,) as hereafter you shall hear.  But whatsoever it was, she cried out to P. Throgmorton of her belly, and said she was full of pain, and further she said, that she had often told him, that she thought there was evil spirits hinted his house, which did thus torment his children, which thing he told her that he did easily believe was true, and now saith she, I verily believe, that one of them is gotten into my belly.  Master Throgmorton said, that all this might very well be true.  So she said,, that it was an evil house, and haunted with spirits, and wished that she had never come into it: he told her that if there were any evil spirits haunted the house, they were of her sending, and so he would grant all that she said.  In the end she passed away that night with groaning and moaning, and the next morning she was very evil at ease she said, but her swelling in her belly was gone, and where her greatest pain was she could not tell, it was in so many places, but her stomach was the best of any other part, and after this she continually complained of one part of her body or other, so long as she stayed in the house.

Within a very short time after, one of the children fell into a most terrible fit mother Samuel standing by, and it was so grievous upon her for the time, as that neither she nor any of her sisters, had the like for the space of a year or two before, and especially her neesing fit was so terrible and strong upon her as if it would have caused

her eyes to start out of her head.  This fit did greatly quail mother Samuel, for she her self did then think, that she should have seen the child dyed at that present, and this wrong out of mother Samuel prayers : so that she desrired the Lord then to help her, and to preserve her in that danger, and she hoped never to see her in the like again.  But the more earnest mother Samuel was in her prayers, the greater was the childes trouble and torment, and the oftener she named God, or Jesus Christ, the stronger the childes fit was upon her.  And at that very instant (as hereafter you shall hear of the rest) when she had thus continued some two hours or more, the spirit spake unto the child and said, that there was a worse fit then this to come yet, wherein she must be worse handled then thus, the child answered, that she cared neither for him nor his dame, but willed them to do their worst they could to her, for (she said) she hoped God would deliver her, and soon after she came forth of her fit and was very well; but the sight of this fit was so terrible to mother Samuel, as she would many times pray that she might never see the like again in any of them.

The children continued still all of them calling upon mother Samuel to make confession of this matter, saying that she must do it before it be long.  And as good at first as at last, but if she would now do it, that they might be well before Christmas, they would then think themselves beholding to her.  They told her further, that now Christmas was at hand, and if she would now confess it; then should be presently well, and keep (by the grace of God ) a merry Christmas.  She answered that she would do for them all the good she could, but for confession of this matter, she would not, for it was a thing she never knew of, nor consented unto.  Their father master Throgmorton, hearing his children and the old woman thus talk together, stepped in and said, Mother Samuel you hear what these children say, which is, that if you would confess this fact, they should be presently well, and they say that you must confess it before it be long, and you know that they have not used to tell lies in their fits.  Now therefore in the name of God, if there be any such matter, confess it: it is

never too late to repent, and to ask for mercy: but she made to him the like answer that she had done to the children before.  Then said he, but what say you to that grievous fit which the spirit of late threatened to my daughter Iane, I would fain know when that should be, Oh saith she (remembering the terror of it) I trust in God I shall never see her in such a case again; nor any of them all.  Yes saith master Throgmorton, I verily think she shall have it, and that shortly, for the spirit you know uses not to fail them in any thing he promises, Oh (saith she) I trust in God she shall never have it, speaking marvelous confidently.  Why saith M. Throg. charge the spirit in the name of God, y she may escape this fit which is threatened.  She presently said, I charge thee spirit in the name of God, that mistress Iane never have this fit.  The child sitting by said, truly the thing saith, I thank God, that I shall never have this fit, that he hath foretold me of. Saith master Throgmorton, why, that is well, thanks be to God, go on mother Samuel, and charge the spirit in the name of GOD, and speak from your heart, that neither she nor any of them all have their fits any more.  So she said as master Throgmorton willed her, speaking marvelous heartily.  The same child again said, truly the thing saith I thank God, that I shall never have it more after the Tuesday after Twelfeday.  Saith master Throgmorton, it is well thanks be to God, charge the spirit again in the name of God, and speak from your heart, and be not afraid, that he depart from them all now at this present, and that he never return to them again, which words she uttered very loud, and very boldly.  So soon as she had ended, then those three children that were then in their fits, & had so continued for the space of three weeks, wiped their eyes, and at that instant thrust back the stools whereon they sat, and stood upon their legs, being as well as ever they were in their lives.  M. Throgmorton had his face now towards the children, & his back to the old woman, & seeing them so to start up suddenly, said thanks be to God.  While he was thus speaking (little knowing or thinking indeed of any such matter) y old woman fell down behind him on her knees & said, good M. forgive me.  He turned him about, and seeing her down, said, why mother Samuel what is the matter? O sir said she, I have been the cause

of all this trouble to your children.  Have you mother Samuel said he? and why so? what cause did I ever give you thus to use me and my children? None at all said she.  Then said master Throgmorton, you have done me the more wrong.  Good master said she, forgive me.  God forgive you said he, and I do: But tell me, how came you to be such a kind of woman? Master, said she, I have forsake my maker, and given my soul to the devil (these were her very words.) And old mistress Throgmorton their grand-mother, and mistresses Throgmorton their mother, begin now in the hall, (for this was done in the parlour,) hearing them very loud (not understanding the matter perfectly) came in into the parlour, of whom, (when mother Samuel saw her) she asked likewise forgiveness.  Mistress Thorgmorton their mother, presently without any questions forgque her with all her heart, yet she could not well tell what the matter was.  Mother Samuel asked those three children that were there forgiveness, and afterwards the rest, kissing all of them: the children easily forgave her, for they knew not that she had offended any of them, in their own persons: (except what they saw in their sisters, when they themselves were out of their fits.)  Master Throgmorton & his wife, perceiving the old woman thus penitent, and so greatly cast down: for she did nothing but weep & lament all this time, comforted her by all the good means they could, and said that they would freely forgive he rfrom their hearts, so be it their children might never be more troubled.  She answered, that she trusted in God, they should never have their fits again, yet would she not be comforted for any thing that they could say.  Then M. Throgmorton did send for M. Doctor Dorrington, the Minister of that town, & told him all the matter with the circumstances, desiring him to comfort her, which they all joining together, did so well as they could at that present: yet could not she forbear weeping, & so continued all that night.  The next day which was the Sabboth day, and Christmas eve, M. Doctor Dorrington chose his text of repentance out of the Psalms, on set purpose to comfort her, and there declared in the open assembly, all the matter of mother Samuelles late confession, applying his speech directly to the comforting of a penitent heart, and so by consequence of her.  All this Sermon

time, mother Samuel did nothing but weep and lament, and many times was so very loud with sundry passions, that she cansed all the church to look on his.  And thus much farther you shall know for this point: master Throgmorton the same day after prayers were ended, very wisely remembering himself, and the old women's inconstancy heretofore, called to mind y there was none present at her confession but himself and master Doctor, with his own household, who might be all thought partial in this matter, willed therefore mother Samuel to come into the body of the church, and there demanded of her before his neighbours, whether that confession which she over night had made to him and master Doctor was wrested wrong out of her, or whether it proceed frankly and freely of and from her self.  She answered before them all that it came of his self, and desired all her neighbours to pray to God for her, and to forgive her.

Towards night master doctor Dorrington understanding the old woman still to continue in this heavy case, came to master Throgmortons house (who is his brother in law by marriage) and entreated him (upon simplicity of good will) tendying the old women's comfort, to give her leave to go home to her husband, and he would be a means that her husband should receive her, and to reconcile them together, wherein the old woman was marvelous dutiful.  To this motion master Throgmorton did easily grant at the first, being as willing to comfort the old woman, as any, and indeed used the means himself also that her husband might receive her, little suspecteing that any thing should fall out thereby otherwise then well.  The man when he understood of it, spoke bluntly (as his manner was) saying that she might come home if she would.

Now that you have heard this old women's confession, it may happily seem strange in some points to some, but for the truth of it, it is as certainly true, as is any part of this book, both the mtter and the manner, and the words also observued in al points, so near as possibly could be remembered.  Mother Samuel is now upon Christmas even at night gone home to her husband and her daughter, where we doubt she hath a cold welcome for her entertainment, and the rather because she hath confessed this matter, for it should seem that they both set upon her (as she her self after

confessed, & so far forth prevailed with her, as that the next morning, which was Christmas day, she denied all that she had said before, and it was no such matter with her.  Before night it came to M. Throgmortons hearing that this new convert had revolted again, and had denied all that she had spoken to him: the best comfort he had herein, was the open confession she made in the church, and thereupon did hardly believe that which was reported of her.

The same day in the evening, master doctor Dorington and M. Throgmorton wet to her house to know the truth, and when they came at the door it pleased God that Iohn Samuel, his wie, and his daughter were talking of this matter; for it should seem that it was all their talk, which they understanding, stayed a while, and heard the daughter say these words, Believe them not, believe them not, for all their fair speeches.  Here upon they went both presently into the house and changed the daughter with these words, which she utterly denied, as did also the father and the mother.  Then did master Throgmorton demand of her, concerning the matter which before she had confessed in his house and in the church, telling her that he had heard that she had denied it again.  She answered, that she would deny that she was a witch, or any cause of the troubling of his children.  Why said he, did not you confess so much unto me? I said so (saith she) indeed, but it is nothing so.  Why then, said he, I must not show you that favour with I promised : I will surely have you before the Justices: but said he, why did you confess it to be so to me, if it be not so? She answered, for joy, For joy, said he, (smiling to himself, marvelling what she could make of it) and why for joy?  Because said she, I did see your children so presently well, after your good prayers and mine.  Then said master Throgmorton unto her, I pray God so continue them, not withstanding howsoever it bee, I will not let posse this matter thus, for seeing it is published, either you or I will bear the shame of it in the end, and so they departed for that night.

The next morning betimes, master Throgmorton went to master doctor Doringtons house, and told him, that he would not suffer this matter thus to die in his hand, least the worser sort of the people should imagine that this was but some devise

of theirs, to bring the old woman into further danger.  So they agreed to approve her once again in this mtter, and sending for her to the Church, they found her father off from confessing anything that she had said or done, then ever she was before.  Then master Throgmorton took her by the hand, and said that both she and her daughter should that day (by Gods grace) go with him to my Lord the Bishop of Lincolnes.  So he presently sent for the Constables, and charged them with the mother and the daughter, and willed them to provide for the journey.

When the old woman perceived preparation for the journey, and the Constables in a readiness, master Throgmorton also putting on of his boots, she came to him and said, Master if you will go with me into the parlour, I well confess all to you alone.  Said he, I will go.  So they went together, and there she confessed the whole matter again unto him which before she had done.  Why then said he, tell me why have you denied it all this time? Oh said she, I would never have denied it but for my husband and my daughter, who said that I was a fool in confessing of it, and that it had been better for me to have died in the same estate I was in, then to confess my self a Witch, for now every body will call me old Witch whilst I live.  Master Throgmorton told her, if she would persist in confessing the truth, he would show her all the favour he could.  In this mean while comes in unto them master Doctor Dorington, and he fell into questioning with her, but she seemed something coldly to confess that unto him which before she had done: so he drew her aside, and master Throgmorton went from them.  Then did master Doctor Dorington call for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote down that confession which she made.  In the mean time master Throgmorton sent to the Church, which is adjoining to his house, and there being divers of his neighbours, for it was about prayers time, he desired them to come to him, and telling them the matter, placed them hard underneath the Parlour window where master doctor and this old woman were talking together.  Whereof when notice was given to master Doctor, he spake very loud, and willed the old woman to lift up her voice also, faining something, so that the neighbours which were without might easily hear all y words that passed between them,  When they had done, M. Throgmorton went unto them into the parlour, & desired them to come forth into the hall : when they came, there stood al y neighbours that had heard this matter, then began M. Doctor to read in their presence that which the woman had confessed, but she would fine have denied al again.  Nay said the neighbours to her, it is too late to deny any thing now, for we heard al this with our ears, telling to her the place where they were.  When she perceived herself thus catched in a trap, she would have made the best of it, but it would not prevail.  As they were thus in the house together, came in Iohn Samuel, the old women's husband, who had understood that there was something to do in the house cocerning his wife.  When he was come, M. Throgmorton told him that which his wife had again confessed, & with the rest he said, that his wife would never have denied that which she did but for him and his daughter.  Hast thou said so: said he to his wife (giving his a foul term) and with that would have stricken her, had not others stood betwixt them.  The old woman perceiving her husband thus fiercely coming towards her, fell down presently in a counterfeit sound before the all.  Mistress Throgmorton standing by, was on the sudden marvellously amassed thereat, & called for aquavit for his.  When they took her up, they perceived her countenance nothing altered, but ath she looked cheerful enough.  One of her neighbours standing by, peradventure better acquainted with her fashions then the rest, said, if they would let her alone, he would be their warrant, that she would doe well enough: so presently after she came to her self again, and al was well.  These circumstances about her confession are therefore the more expressly set down although they be not so pertinent to the matter, neither indeed should have been declared at all, had it not ben reported by some in the country, and those that thought themselves wise, that this mother Samuel now in question, was an old simple woman, and that one might make her by fair words confess what they would.  But to leave that to the judgment of them that knew her well enough, Master Throgmorton continued on his journey, purposing to discharge himself of the matter, and caused the old woman with her daughter to be carried the same day to my :. the Bishop of Lincoln, and there he examined her and her daughter.

The Examination of Alice Samuel of Warbois, in the county of Huntinngton, taken at Buckden before the right reverend Father in God, William, by Gods permission Bishop of Lincoln, the 26 of December, 1592.

Being asked whether a dun chicken did ever suck on her chin, and how often, the said Examinat saith, that it sucked twice and no more since Christmas evens even last. Being asked whether it was a natural chicken, she saith that it was not, she knows that it was no natural chicken, because when it came to her chin she scarce feel it, but when she wiped it off with her hand, her chin did bleed. She saith further, that the said dun chicken first come unto her and suck on her chin before it came to M. Throgmortons house, and that the ill and the trouble that hath come to M. Throgmortons children, hath come by means of the said dun chicken, the which chicken she knows is now both gone from them and from her.  And further she saith, that M. Throgmorton and M. doctor Dorington shall bring further information of such things as yet she hat not declared. 

The Examination of Alice Samuel of Warboyi in the County of Huntington, taken at Buckden the 29 day of December 1592, before the reverend Father in God, William by Gods permission Bishop of Lincoln, Francis Crumwell, and Richard Tryce, Esquires, Justices of her Maiesty's peace within the County aforesaid.

She saith that she never did hurt to any, saving to the children in question. Being demanded how she knows the said dun chicken is gone from the said children: she saith, because the said dun chicken, with the rest, are now come into her, and are now in the bottom of her belly, and make her so full, that she is like to burst, and this morning they caused her to be so full, that she could scant lace her cote, and that on the way as she came, they weighed so heavy, that the horse she rid on did fall down and was not able to carry her.  And further she saith that the upright man of whom she hath confessed to master Throgmorton, told her that M. Throgmorton

was a hard man & would trouble her much, wherefore he would give her six spirits that should vex and torment his children, and so he did: which spirits had reward from her by sucking of her blood oftentimes when they were without her body, and that the said spirits did suck of her blood before she sent the forth any whither. She saith further, that whatsoever the children of M. Throg. did speak in their fits proved true & was true: as for example, whosoever the said children said they did see the said spirits, then were the spirits there, & she did also see the. And she saith, y often times she did give a privy beck or nod, with her finger or head, & then the spirits presently stopped the childrens mouths, that they could not speak until they came out again: & then would y children wipe their eyes and be well again. Further she saith, that it was taught her of a ma that did come unto her house, but where he dwell, or what his name was, she cannot tell, who told her that if she would call the said six spirits they would come: and she called them, & they appeared in the likeness of dun chickens, their names were as follows: first, Pluck; second, Catch; the third White; and the other three she called with her mouth with three smacks: and two of them, she (this examinate) sent to M. To. Throgmorton of Warbois and his wife, and they returned again, and told her that God would not suffer them to prevail. Whereupon she (this Examinat) sent the said spirits to the children of the said M. Throg. by means of whereof they have ben so strangely tormented, as to the neighbours and country hath been seen. She saith further, that what the children speak in their fits in her hearing, y it was true, & so it fell out.   Being asked further what the upright mans name was that gavu her the devils, she said that she could not tell: whereupon she was moved to go into another chamber, & demand of her spirits what his name was, which she presently did,  & there with a loud voice said these words as follows O thou devil, I charge thee in the name of the Father, the Son, & the Holy-ghost, that thou tel me the name of the upright man which gave me the devils: which thing she did three times, and the returned saying, that her spirits had told her y his name was Langlad. And being demanded where the said Langland dwelled, she said she could not tell. Then was she moved to go into the said chamber again, and demand of her spirits where y said Langland dwelt: which

also she presently did, and there with a loud voice three times said, O devil I charge thee in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy-ghost tel me where the said Langland dwells, then she returned and said that he had no dwelling. Then was she further moved to go again & demand where y said Langland was at that present, which also she did, and demanded as before, & returned with this answer, That her spirits told her that he went on the last voyage beyond the seas.  After these cofessions thus made, mother Samuel and his daughter were committed to the gail of Huntington. Now that we have brought mother Samuel to the gail, we will let her there rest in Gods peace and the Queens until the next general Assizes day holden at Huntington, and  although many things fell out unhappily concerning her, during her continuance in the gail, whereof she was greatly suspected, as the death of one of the Gaylers servants whom she threatened, the extreme sickness of one of his children, with his present ammending after the scratching of her, and diverse other things which are shrewd pieces of evidence against her, if there had been nothing else laid to her charge: yet because they doe not concern the trouble of these children, neither is a matter so perfectly known to the authors of this book, it is therefore but touched by the way.

And to come to the daughter Agnes Samuel, who now comes upon the stage with her part in this tragedy, you shall understand that she was left with her mother in the gail until the Sessions day held at Huntington the 9 of January following, which day was the Tuesday that the children so often had spoken of to the old woman.

At dinner time M. Throgmorton made his request to the high Sheriff & the Justices to bail this maid, & to have her home to his house, to see, if it might please God, whether any such evidences of guiltiness would appear against her, as had before appeared in the children against the mother. This suit was not easily granted, for it was a demur amongst the Justices whether the maid was baylable by law in this case or no.  In the end M. Throgmorton cotinuing his suit, they being resolved of y doubt, and granted it: but it was almost three of the clock in the afternoon before, as every body ca witness y were the present: which time
is therefore here mentioned because it hath relation to the next point that hereafter follows, as you shall hear.

The report of M. Doctor Dorington of that which happened at Warbois, on Tuesday which was the Sessions day at Huntington, the 9 of January.

About twelve of the clock a little before dinner, Mary, Ione, and Grace, the

daughters of Robert Throgmorton of Warbois aforesaid, Esquier, fell into their accustomed fits of lameness, blindness, deafness, and want of feeling, only their youngest brother Robert of the age of nine years, might speak unto Iane with her understanding, and she only might speak in the like manner to Marie and Grace.

Immediately after dinner their uncle M. doctor Dorington parson of Warbois, coming to see the with a scholar of Cambridge, found them all three in their fits, which seemed not so grievous at that time as merry and pleasant, repeating oftentimes these words, each one of the: I am glad, I am glad, none so glad as I.  The said M. doctor their uncle, willed their brother to ask the wherefore they were so glad.  Iane answered him, we shall know within these two hours good news, still wishing that two hours were spent, the two other sisters affirmed the same.  Mary and Iane whispering secretly one in the others care, spake thus much in our hearing oftentimes: I marvel how she should know that thing, I am sure none of this house told her, and therefore it cannot be but that the spirits told her.  The said Robert was willed again by his uncle doctor to ask of Iane, and Iane to ask of Mary and Grace, when they should come forth of this fit, they all answered, Now by and by, and then we shall go well al of us into the hall, out of this parlour, and thence returning quickly y hither again, we shall presently enter into another fit like unto this, and then you shall hear news, for by that time the two hours will be almost spent: yet after we have told the news we shall have a paying fit, but it shall be short.  All these things foretold, proved most true, fur they came out of their fit perfectly well, they did arise off from their stools themselves, and all three of them went first out of the great Parlour into an inward less Parlour, to see how their mother did then being not well at case, and
keeping her bed.  Presently they went from this into the hall, to see their sister Elizabeth then sitting by the fire, and being there, they were willed by one of their kinswomen in the house, not to return any more into the said parlour, but notwithstanding that counsel, they would needs go all three into the parlour.  They were no sooner entered into the said place, but every one of them fell into their former fits, lame, blind, and deaf, insomuch as they must needs be carried to their stools by the fire side : where being once placed, they began to repeat again, I am glad, I am glad, none so glad as I, and being demanded why, they answered all three that Agnes Samuel should be brought to their fathers house from Huntington, and they should not hear Agnes Samuel as they did her mother, in their firts because their father should not trouble her with any mo questions, and so the spirit tells them.  These words uttered they all severally, being asked one after the other, and then they all together fell presently into extreme fits, of bowing their bodies, their heads and feet almost meeting together, their bellies being highest with great groaning.  But this endured not long (thanks be to God,) then rubbing their eyes twice or thrice, they seemed as waking out of a sleep, and so became perfectly well as ever before, Iane uttering these words to the spirit, which as it should seem should say, we are gone: then mistress Iane answered, farewell and be hanged.  Their uncle Doctor there present with the rest, giving thanks to God, asked them all how they did, and they said very well we thank God, again being asked how they felt themselves all this time of two hours past, they said y they had bin in a sleep.  He asked them further, if they had dined, which thing he knew they had done, for he found them al at dinner merry and pleasant, yet they answered, they had not dined, and yet they had no stomachs.

After  Agnes Samuel was brought to master Throgmortons house, the children continued for three or four days without any fits at all, so that their parents were put in great comfort that their children should then have been clean delivered from their torments: but it should seem, that the matter was not yet brought to an end, for the children fell all of them a fresh into their fits again, and were as grievously afflicted as ever

they were in the old women's time, and then the spirits did begin, as plainly to accuse the daughter as ever they did the mother, and do tell the children that the old woman hath set over her spirits to her daughter, and that she hath bewitched them al over again, and that she will deal worse with them then ever her mother did. The children in their fits carried the same mind to the daughter and to her spirits, as they did to the mother before, saying that they cared not for any thing, that any of them all could do unto them, for their trust was in God, and he would deliver them out of her hands (they said;) many very strange things fell out amongst them in one month next after, which because they were not particularly committed to writing, they are therefore here omitted.

Some after, the maid was thus brought as you here, to continue at M. Throgmortons house: mistress Join the eldest daughter of the said M. Throgmorton, was brought home likewise fro Tichmarsh grove, where we left her, to Warbois to her fathers house, and if it should particularly be declared how she was dealth withal for the time she there continued, it wold ad another third part unto this book, & you wold think also that y matters which could be spoken of her, would be nothing superfluous: but to let al that posse, let us come unto this present matter, as it was particularly observed at Warbos.

Upon Friday which was the 9. of February 1592, Mistress Join the eldest daughter of the said M. Throgmorto, fell into his fit as usually before she had done, & complained of great pain in her legs, which had bin sore 9. or 10. weeks before that, namely, the most part of y time, while she continued at Tichmarsh grove, with her uncle M. Gilbert Pickering.  But after she returned home to her sisters, she grew much worse in her legs the before, and for y space of a full fortnight before this day, her legs were so full of ache & pain, that she could neither walk nor sit, but only lye either upon her bed, or else upon cushions by the fire side.  Cotinuing thus in her fit all that day, towards night the spirit came unto her, & she talked very familiarly with it, as her common custom was, demanding of it from whence it came, and what news it brought, speaking very disdainfully to it.  The thing answered, that it would not tell her from whence it came, but this was the

news it brought, that she should have very extreme fits hereafter, and be worse handled than ever she was : saying that she should now have her fits, being in perfect memory, and having al her senses.  She answered, that she neither feared nor cared for him, for God she said was on her side, and would protect her from him, so the thing departed without any further talk, and she continued in her fit, the most part of that night until she went to bed.

The next day, which was Saturday, the tenth of February, for it would be too long to speak of every particular hour, although almost every hour brought variety with it, in the afternoon as she lay groaning in her fit by the fire side, she fell suddenly into bleeding at the nose, and bleed very much, whereat she marvelled (for she did perceive it) saying, I pray God send me good news after this, for it is strange with me to bleed, I bled not not so much this seven years before, when she had much bloudied her handkercheffe, she said that it was a good deed to throw the handkercheffe into the fire and burn the Witch, for she knew she said, that this bleeding came of no good cause. After she had talked thus to her self a little, it should seem the spirit came to her: for she said thus smiling to her self, and casting her eyes about her, what is this in Gods name, that comes thus tumbling to me? It tumbles like a football, I think it be some puppit-plaier, it is much like his dames old thrumd cap. What is your name I pray you said she? The thing answered (as it should seem) that his name was Blew. For presently upon the question demanded of his dame, she made answer again her self saying: Master Blew you are welcome, I never saw you before, I thought said she, that my nose bled not for nothing, what news have you brought? It told her as before. What doest thou say saith she, that I shall be worse handled then ever I was? Ha: saith she, what doest thou say?  (For she would ever repeat the spirits words after him as they all would do, when they were talking with them, bending their heads to the ground) that I shall now have my fits, when I shall both hear, see, and know every body, that is a new trick indeed, I think never any of my sisters were so used, but I care not
for you (said she) do your worst. And when you have done, you will make an end, these were her very words.

Then was she silent a while, yet seemed to listen to something that the spirit did say, and presently called for Agnes Samuel, and asked where she was, saying y she had but too much liberty, and that she must be more straightly looked unto, for of late (said she) she was in y kitchen chamber talking with her spirits (for so master Blew had told her) and entreated him not to let me have any such extreme fits, when I should both speak, hear, & know every body.  But he answered, that he would torment me in y sort, and not give over until he had brought his dame, meaning Agnes Samuel, unto her end.  So that now, saith mistress Join to her (for by that time she was called into the place to her) you have spun a fair thread: you devils (for so then she called them) will be no longer at your commandment: it will be no better with us, said she, until you & your mother be both hanged.  The maid standing by and hearing this, confessed indeed that she was in the kitchen chamber and alone: but she denied that she talked with any spirits, nor yet knew of any such things.  Mistress Join hearing her say so: willed her not to deny it, for it was surely so, she thought, saying, that she knew the spirits would not lye to her.  Soon after, she came out of this fit, and greatly complained of pain in her legs, and being presently demanded where she had been, and what she had said.  She answered that she had been a sleep, and had said nothing that she knew of, marvelling much how her handkerchiffe which she had in her hand, should come to be so bloody, for said she, it was not so eve now, & I am sure that I use not to bleed: I believe said she, some body took it from me, and bloudied it & hath given me it again, (for this is the same handkerchiffe I had even now, with many such like speeches.

At night presently, on her father and mothers rising from supper, she fell into the fit which before M. Blue had threatened her, for she was most grievously wrong & twitched in every part of her body, sometimes she wold thrust forth her arms so straight, and so stiff, that it was not possible to bow them: sometimes again, she would so wrest and writhe them clean backwards as that no man or woman were able to do the like, by their
natural strength, she her self crying out very pitifully, sometimes of her stomach, saying that she was very sick, and offered to vomit, sometimes of her head, and other whiles of her belly, and never a part or member of her, was free from extreme pain, she her self ever calling upon God to think upon her, and deliver her. Sometimes it would so stop her breath, and hold it so long, that when she could recover it again, she fetched a marvellous deep and loud groan. And being oftentimes asked in this fit by divers that stood by how she did, she made answer, that she was marvellous sick and full of pain, affirming that she both heard and saw, all that were present. In this woeful case she continued the space of half an hour and more, to the great grief of the beholders, (for this is one of the first fits, that either she or her sisters had, having their perfect senses.) Now on the sudden as she was thus complaining, she fell into her senseless fit, having her mouth also shut up, and now she is deprived of all manner of sense again. Remaining thus quietly a little space, she fetched a great groan, whereupon her mouth was opened, and she spake saying: Here is a rule indeed, I perceive that you are as good as your word with me, from whence come you now, and what news do you bring now I pray you? The thing answered, that she must be yet worse handled then all this comes unto. Saith she, God is above the devil, and do what you can, for you shall not be able to hurt me. But tell me, why do you punish me worse then all my sisters, having my fits when I can know every body?  The thing answered, because she told tales of their dame: who is your dame (saith she?) he answered Nan Samuel. And this you must understand, in all their manner of talking together, that the children would first repeat the spirits answer, before they would ask any further question of them. The said she, if Nan Samuel be your dame, I will tell more tales of her yet, and I hope to tell such a tale of her one day, that she shall not be able to answer it, nor you for her. The thing answered, that he would then punish her the more for it. She said that she cared not for that. Then said the thing, when was Smack with you?  (This Smack was an other of the spirits names.) Saith she, I know no such fellow as Smack is, yes saith the thing,that you do: and he it is that tells you all these things, but I will course him for it. Saith she, do your

worst to him or to me, for I care not for you. Farewell, saith the thing. Do you bid me farewell, saith she? fare you well & be hanged (for you shall have the truth as she spoke it) & come again saith she when you are sent for.  Soon after this she came forth of her fit and was very sick, and full of pain in her legs.  The next day which was the Sabboth, she was reasonable well all the forenoon, as she was all other days, but her greatest pangs & fits were always towards night.  And thus leaving her until night, you shall hear what happened, the same day, amongst others of her sisters.  Soon after dinner was ended, there came unto the house one master Throgmorton of Brampton, to see how these children did, & staying in the parlour a little while, one of these children, mistress Elizabeth by name, as she was coming in at the parlour door, fell suddenly into her fit in the sight of them all, which was not strange to any, but to the gentleman (because it was an usual thing with her.) Cotinuing thus a little space, M. Throgmorton the childes father, said to the other M. Throgmorton his kinsman, will you see cousin saith he, a wonder? Saith the gentleman, have you any greater wonders the to see this sight?  Saith the childes father, I have as great, for you shall se this child brought out of this case wherein now you see her, at the pronouncing of certain words by a maid in this house.  Saith the gentleman, I would fine see that, for i am sorry to see this signed.  So the childes father called for Agnes Samuel, and willed her to say to the child these words, I charge thee devil in the name of the God of heaven and earth as I hate thee, an am no Witch, nor guilty of this matter, that thou depart from this child, and suffer her to come forth of her fit.  This said by the maid, the child moved not.  Then the childes father willed her to say thus, I charge thee thou devil, as I love thee, and have authority over thee, and am a Witch, and guilty of this matter, that thou suffer this child to be well at this present.  These words were no sooner ended, but the child wiped her eyes, and was as well as any in the parlour.  As the gentleman was thus wondering and talking with this maid about the matter, saying that she could tel a pretty tale for her self, another of those children mistress Iane standing by fell presently into her fit, and the same experience was made by her, as was made by her sister before.  And this was

very usual amongst them, for it had been proved divers times, and was foretold by the spirit to one of them being in her fit, (a fortnight before this time:) that whenever Agnes Samuel should say these words, they should be presently well.

To return to mistress Join, who was very sick & full of pain all that day, & when night came, presently after supper fell into the same manner of fit, which she had the night before, for she was most grievously twitched, wrong, & tormented in every part of her body, having her perfect senses, for she was able to see, hear, and understand, every thing that was asked of her, & this kind of fit continuing some certain space, she fell on the sudden into a senseless fit: and being silent a while, having her mouth shut up, she fetched a great groan, and said, from whence come you M. Smack, and what news do you bring? The spirit answered, that he came from fighting.  From fighting saith she, with who, I pray you? The spirit answered with Pluck, (which was an other of the spirits names.)  Where did you fight I pray you said she? The spirit answered in his old dames backhouse, which is an old house standing in mother Samuels yard, and they fought with great cowlstraves, this last night.  And who got the maistry I pray you said she?  He answered that he broke Plucks heard.  Saith she, I would that he had broke your neck also.  Saith the spirit, is that all the thank that I shall have for my labour? Why saith she, do you look for thanks at my hands?  I would you were all hanged up one against another, and your dame and all, for you are all nought, but it is no matter saith she, I do not well to curse you, for God I trust will defend me from you all.  So he departed and had her farewell.  And being asked by her when he would come again, he said on Wednesday at night, he was no sooner gone, but presently came Pluck to her.  For she said, from whence come you Pluck, with your head hanging down in that sort.  So he answered her in all respects, according as Smack before had told her.  Then said the spirit to her, when saw you Smack.  She answered, that she knew no such fellow.  He said, yes that she did, but she wold not be to know of him.  It should seem said she, that you have met with your match, & with divers such like speeches betwixt the he departed.  And she soon after came out of her fit, but was very il, & complained of pain in her legs.  The next day being monday, she

was very sick all the day, and in the afternoon she fell into a marvellous extreme fit having perfect sense, for the space of half an hour or more.  Agnes Samuel standing by, and seeing the extremity thereof, seemed to pray with others very heartily for her: for the greevousnesse of that sight would have moved any stony heart in the world to pity.  And being asked of the matter, what she thought of it, and whether it was wantonness or not, as she had oftentimes said before, she came to the house (as well as her mother had done) but now she could not deny, but that it was some supernatural work in the patient.  Notwithstanding as may be thought, she that was thus tormented, never once conceived an evil thought against her, all the time that she had her perfect senses: this kind of fit ended she was well excepting the pain in her legs.  After supper, so soon as her parents were risen with the rest, she fell into the same fit again having her senses, and within half an hour, she was on the sudden snatched into her senseless fit, and presently she had her mouth opened, & said, will this gear never be left?  I hope it will be better one day with you, from whence come you now Catch (saith she) limping in that sort? I hope you have met with your match.  Catch answered, that Smack and he had been fighting, and that Smack had broken his leg.  Said she, that Smack is a shrewd fellow belike, I would I could once see him.  Pluck came yesternight (said she) with his head broken, and now he hath broken your leg, I hope said she, that he will break both your necks before he have done with you.  Catch answered, that he would be even with him before he had done.  Then said she, put forth your other leg, let me see if I can break that also, for she had a stick in her hand, the spirit told her that she could not hit him.  Can I not hit you said she? let me try.  Then the spirit as it should seem, put out his leg, for she lifted up her stick easily, and suddenly gave a great stroke on the ground.  You have not hurt me said the spirit.  Have I not hurt you said she?  no, but I would if I could, for then would I make some of you come short home.  So she seemed divers times to strike at the spirit, but he leaped over y stick as she said, as if it had bin a Jacke of Apes.  So after many such toys used betwixt them, the spirit departed, & she came forth of her fit, continuing all that night and the next day very sick, and full of pain in her legs.  At night when supper was ended she fell into her sensible fit again, and continuing therein half an hour, she fell into another kind of fit which is common to her & the rest of her sisters, and resting so silent a little space, she fetched a great groan & said, Na sirrah, are you come now with your arm in a sling M. Blew? who hath met with you I pray? The spirit answered, You know well enough. Do I know (said she) well enough? how should I know? Why (said the spirit) Smack and I were fighting, and he hath broken mine arm, said she, that smack is a stout fellow indeed belike, I hope he will break all your necks because you punish me without a cause.  I would said she that I could once be acquainted with him.  We will be even with him (says Blew) one day.  Why said she, what will you do?  The spirit said, That they would all fall upon him and beat him.  Said she, Belike he cares not for you all, for he hath broken Plucks head, Catches leg, and your arm, now you have something to do, you may go heal your arm.  Yea (said the spirit) when mine arm is whole we will beat Smack.  So for that night they parted, and she came out of her fit, complaining of many parts of her body, so as it should seem that she was more hearty and better at ease while the spirit talked with her by far, then she was when she came forth of her fit, for she would greatly complain of her legs all the day, and the most part of the night in like sort, so that she herself took little rest, and disquieted them that lay near her.  The next day which was Wednesday, she was very ill, and when night came and supper was ended, she first fell into her sensible fit, and after that was ended, she fell into her senseless fit.  Anon, fetching a great sigh, she said, Who sent for you master Smack?  He made answer that he was come according to his promise which he made unto her on Sunday at night.  Belike said she, you will keep promise, but I had rather that you would keep you away, and come when I send for you: but what news have you brought?  I told you said he, that I had been a fighting the last Sunday night, but I have had many battles since.  Yea so it seems, saith she, for here was both Pluck, Catch, and Blew, and they all came maimed unto me.  Yea, said he, I have met with them all.  But I marvel, said she, that you could beat them, they are very great, and you are but a little

one.  Said he, I am good enough for two of the best of them together.  But said she, I can tell you news.  What is that, said he? They will all at one time fall upon you and beat you.  He said, He cared not for that, he would beat two of the best of them.  And who shall beat the other two, said she?  for there is one that hath been many times spoken of, and he carries the name of Hardname, for his name stands upon eight letters, and every letter stands for a word, but what his name is we know not (only Hardname.)  The spirit answered, that his cosine Smacks would help him to beat the other two.  There are also two other Smacks as you may read in the old women's confession.  What said she, shall your cousins Smacks help you?  What, is there kindred amongst devils?  I never heard of that thing before, that the devils were cousins.  God keep me from that kindred.  Such like foolish talk they had together at that time.  In the end, the spirit said, You shall have no more such fits as you have had.  No, said she, that is well, but you can do nothing but lie.  Why said he, will you not believe me?  No, said she, shall I believe the Devil, who is the father of all lies?  But you shall find it true said he.  If I doe, then will I believe you, said she, but not before.  I pray God it be true, but whether it be true or not, I care not a rush for you.  No, said he, will you not thank me?  Thank you, said she, hang you and all your fellows, for I will not believe you no father then I see you, neither doe I care for any of you all.

This Smack hath oftentimes gone about to win her favour, making very fair promises to her that he would do any thing for her, if she would love him.  But it hath pleased God by the work of his good spirit, that she hath always withstood him, denying him and defying him to the uttermost, wishing all evil to light upon him and his fellows, for so tormenting her and her sisters without cause, always desiring the assistace of Gods holy spirit to preserve her & her sisters from such temptations.  In the end, she said, You have told me many times that I should scratch Agnes Samuel, tell me now, when shall I scratch her?  The spirit answered, that she should scratch her before the Assizes.  What said she, shall she stad before y judges with a scratched face? Yea, said the spirit, so it should be.  She answered, that she would set it on

whenever she did it: and said she, look that you be as good as your word in this matter, for I would fain scratch her, for whatsoever the matter is, said she, I cannot abide her now adays, and I am sick when I look on her, (and so indeed she was) for she would not suffer her willingly to stay in her company when she was out of her fit: and being asked the cause why, she said she could not tell, for she did bear her no malice nor grudge in the world, neither did she give her any evil words, yet she said, she loathed her company.  In the parting, the spirit told her that she should have no mo fits after y Assizes.  No, said she, I am very glad of that.  But said the spirit, if you have then, wo be to Agnes Samuel, for I will bring her to her end.  And thus the spirit left her, not saying any thing of his return, and she presently came out of her fit, and was much better then ordinarily she used to be, and the next day she was able to go very well on her legs, whereof she had no use a whole month before.

On Monday next following, which was the twentieth of February after supper, she began to talk again, having been in her fit an hour or more before, for she had eat her supper in her fit, with two other also of her sisters that were in their fits. On the sudden she said, What, are you come now? I had thought you would have come no more, and that we would have been well rid of you; but where have you been, said she? He answered, that his cosine Smack and he, had been fighting with Pluck & Catch, and they had beaten them both very much, so that they dare not come to her any more. So they had very much talk about fighting and such other matters, which before are set down. In the end she asked when she should scratch Agnes Samuel. The spirit answered, that if she would now scratch her, then her face would be whole before the Assizes, which must not be. So she willed him to look to that which he promised, for she would keep her nails for her. Yea, saith the spirit, & she was also consenting to the death of the Lady Crumwel. What saith mistress Join, was she also consenting to the death of Lady Crumwel? even like enough, I thought so, saith she. Yea, saith the spirit, & to prove this to be true, whenever any stranger shall come into the house, you shall fall into your fit, and if then Agnes Samuel shall come unto you and say, As I am a Witch, and consenting

to the death of Lady Crumwell, so I charge thee to depart and to let her come forth of her fit, you shall presently well.  So Mistress Join repeated the same words after the spirit which were then set down in writing. If it be so, saith mistress Join, why then I hope she shall be hanged at the assizes as well as her mother, and that sir Henrie Crumwell will look to that matter. In the shutting up of the talk, the spirit told her that she should have her fits upon the Assizes day, and all manner of fits which at any time she ever had, but after the Assizes day she should have no mo fits, but if she had, then wo be to Agnes Samuel. for then (saith the spirit) I will make her pay for it

Upon Friday following when supper was ended, she fell into her talking fit again, having had a very solemn fit an hour before that time.  On the sudden she said, Smack where have you been all this time? and how chance I talked not with you having been in my fits divers times of late?  Saith Smack, I was not at home, but now I bring you good news.  What is that, said she?  The spirit said, You shall have no more fits until this day seven-night, if you will arise betimes to morrow morning, otherwise if you do not, you shall have your fit in the monring, which shall continue all the day to your trouble.  Then said she, If rising early will prevent my fit, I will God willing, get up betimes to morrow morning; which indeed she did, and escaped her fit that day.  Then she demanded why she should have no mo fits that week.  The spirit answered, that Agnes Samuel entreated him that you should have no mo fits, even as I loved her: but said he, I love her not, yet you shall have no mo fits this week, except some strangers come, if you will arise to morrow betimes.  And why, said she, must I have my fits if strangers come?  The spirit answered, To bring her to shame.  But when did you talk with her, said she? Even now said the spirit in the Church chamber.  She will deny that, said mistress Join, when she is asked of it.  Yea, said the spirit, so it stands her in hand: and you must have one whole week of very sick fits, said the spirit, before the Assizes.  Must I, said she, for whole soul?  Agnes Samuel will have it so, said the spirit.  Let me know, said she, when that day shall be.  You shall know this day seven-night said he,

and in what sort likewise your fit shall be.  Before they parted, the spirit asked how her legs did.  She said, well thanks be to Gd, why do you ask?  He said, because he was glad of it.  Be glad for your self said she, and be not glad for me, for I will never thank you for it, neither doe I posse for you a rush, for God I trust will deliver me in despite of you.  So for that time he departed, and she came out of her fit and was very well, and so continued all the next day, arising betimes in the morning.  On Sunday following, being the 25 of February, M. Throgmorton of Brampton who was the first stranger y came next to the house (and is before named,) within one half hour after his coming, mistress Join fell into her fit, & had not long so continued, but Smack came to her, to whom she said, How chances it that I have my fit now, and you promised that I should not have it before Friday next: He said, that she knew well enough.  She said, she did not: the next: He said, that she knew well enough.  She said, she did not: the he told her that strangers were come, and now she must have her fit to prove Agnes Samuel a witch.  Amongst other talk, the spirit told her again, that there was a very sore week of sick fits to come ere it be long.  She said, she cared not for it, for she hoped that God would stand with her then, as well as he had done hitherto.  As she sat thus in her fit talking with Smack, one of her sisters sat by her, (being in a very quiet fit also) on the sudden she said: Sister Join (for so was the child's name that sate by her) the thing tells me that you shall have a very sore fit by and by.  The words were no sooner ended, but her sister fell into a marvellous sick and troublesome fit, swelling and heaving in her body, groaning and crying out as their manner was.  Then M. Throg. the child's father called for Agnes Samuel, & willed her to hold the child, for saith, I think you are best worthy to have the trouble of it.  After the child had ben in her arms struggling & very troublesome a certain space, her sister that before had foretold of the sick fit she had, spake, saying, Be of good comfort sister Iane, for the thing tells me that the worst is past, & you shall be well by and by: for the thing saith that Nan Samuel is weary withholding of you, & therefore you shall be well, which presently proved true, for her troublesome fit then ended, & she continued in a very quiet fit as before.  Presently, upon this M. Throg. the child's father, told the other M. Throg. his cosine, what words his daughters

Join before had spoken, namely, that when any strangers came, she should thereupon fall into her fit, and then if Nan Samuel should speak such and such words, she should come forth of her fit to prove her a Witch.  M. Throgmorton the stranger earnestly desired to make proof thereof.  So the child's father bad Nan Samuel say after him, Even as I am a witch, and consented to the death of the Lady Crumwel, so I charge thee spirit to depart, and to let her be well.  The maid  began to speak them, but either she could not, or else she would not speak them plain, but she would always say, Consenting to our death of our Lady Crumwell; and she would not after three or four times repeating over, speak the words plain: so that she that was in her fit said, Here is something tells me, that she will not speak them aright.  In the end after much ado she spake them, and presently she came out of her fit, and was very well.  The same words were used to another of them that then was in her fit, & prevailed as well with her as with her sister.  The next day at dinner mistress Elizabeth being in her fit, was pointed unto to say grace, & when she had half gone through it, presently her mouth was shut up that she could not finish it.  Then M. Throg. called for Nan Samuel, and willed her to charge the spirit to open her mouth again, that she might finish her grace, which the maid did, and the child went through her grace, to the end of it.  And this you should have seen in common use amongst them, that if three or four of them had stood together ready to say grace, you should have seen them all taken suddenly in their fits one after the other as they had begun to speak, or at the furthest before they had spoken two lines, & their mouths also shut up, that they could not speak at al.  Then M. Throg. laboured to teach Agnes Samuel a grace of two or three lines, but he could by no means get her to learn it by heart, although he caused his children to teach it her divers times in a day.  On Thursday following which was the first of March, mistress Mary, who had been well and without any fits ever since the Sessions day last at Huntington, was something evil at ease all the morning, and about nine of the clock fell into a marvelous great quaking & trembling, and could not hold a joint of her, yet knew no cause why.  Soon after she was taken and fell into a marvelous trouble

some fit, continuing therein about half an hour: in the end she waxed a little better, and said, Is it true?  do you say, This is the day wherein I must scratch the young witch?  I am heartily glad of it, for I will surely pay her home, both for my self and my sisters.  Master Edward Pickering and M. Henrie Pickering, two of the child's uncles standing by, which divers others caused the maid to be brought up into the chmber where the child was, to see what would be the issue of it, knowing very well that the maid was able to keep her self from scratching, if three such as the child was should set upon her at once.  So soon as the maid came into the chamber where the child was, the child said, Art thou come thou young Witch, who hast done all this mischief?  The maid seemed to stand amazed at those words, for she was not accustomed to hear any such hard speeches from the child.  So one in the company willed the maid to take up the child and carry her down (for her legs were taken from her.)  Mistress Mary suffered her self very quietly to be taken up in her arms, and clasped her hands about her neck, but even as the maid began to lift up, she fell on scratching of her so eagerly and so fiercely, as that it was a wonder to all that saw it, saying, I will scratch you, you young witch, and pay you home for thus punishing of me and my sisters: the thing tells me, that I had been well, and never should have had my fits any more but for you.  The maid stood still holding down her head (for the child keeled upon her knees) and cried very pitifully, yet either would not, or could not once pluck away her head.  Nay said the child, I know you cry, but the spirit said that I should not hear you, because I should not pity you, and he is that holds you now that you cannot get away from me.  So the child scratched her face until the skin came of, the breadth of a shiling, but there came no blood at all but water.  In the end the maid brought her down into the Parlour, where the child sitting a while in her stool, seemed to be wonderful sorry for that she had done, and said, I would not have scratched Nan Samuel, but the thing told me that I should doe it, and forced me there unto, stretching forth mine arms, and straining my fingers whether I would or not, and made me to scratch her.  And truly they that saw the manner of it, and knew the mild disposition of the child, might costly see that she was overruled in the action, for she was carried with such vehemence and cruelty for the time, against the maid, as that it appeared to be altogether besides her nature.  The child continued in her fit till an hour after dinner, & then being asked of these matters, was altogether ignorant of any such thing, and would not believe it, but when she saw the example in the maids face, & being told that she had done it, she brake into tears, and was marvelous sorry to see it.  The next day, being Friday, mistress Mary was in the very mild and solemn fit all the morning, and a little before dinner she said to her self and her sisters that were also in their fits: I am glad and marvelous glad, but she wold not tel the cause why.  Presently she said to the thing that stood by her, But I know you will lie to me as you have oftertimes done.  Nay, said the thing.  I use not to lie.  No do, said she, who are you I pray you?  The thing answered, Smack.  What said she, are you that Smack that uses to come to my sister Join, & tells her so many things?  Yea, said he, saying further that he never told her sister Join any lie hitherto, neither was this a lie that he told her.  Then mistress Mary declared to her sisters, being all in their fits, that which Smack had told her, which was, that after diner she should come of her fit, & never more have any fit, because she had scratched Agnes Samuel So her sisters wished that Smack would come to them, and tell them the same.  So after dinner she came forth of her fit, as she said, and never had more fits afterword from that day to this (thanks be to God.)  The very same day being the 2 of February mistress Join fell in the morning into her fit, & being in her bed, it should seem y Smack had bin with her, & had told her something as afterword she did declare to her sisters, being in their fits: for she said, I will get up and go down, & tell some news.  When she was come down into y parlour, & had sate by y fire some little space, she spake on the sudden to something y stood by her, saying: I will not vouchsafe to look on you, for you never come but you bring some ill news with you, for I was sick y last time you were here, and I marvel who sent for you now?  The thing answered her, You were sick in deed the last time I was here, but now you shall be much worse.  Why do your worst said she, for I posse not for you (seeming to speak very angrily to him) for God, said she, will

preserve me, I fear you not.  I marvel said she how your leg both?  I think Smack spoke with you when he brake your leg, Yea said he, I pray you do not tel Smack that I was here: do you pray me? said she, I do not know that Smack, but if I did, I wold surely tell him, that he might break your neck also.  The thing answered, yes you know him well enough, for you made him break my leg, but I would not for any thing, that he should know that I was here said y thing, but I will make you pay for all this week that comes in.  Will you? saith she, I will lay with you what you will, that I shall not be sick this week if I list, for one thing that I know.  Yea saith he.  I know very well that Smack was with you this morning, but do both of you what you can, you shall have a sick week of it, & that you shall find, foe you shall be so sick this next week, that your body shall be sore al the next week after, for I will course you, as well as Smack hath coursed me.  Why said she, do you revenge your self upon me and not upon Smack? He said that he durst not deal with him, for he was too hard for him.

After a little silence betwixt them, she asked her sisters, that were likewise in their fits, if they did not see Catch who talked with her even now?  They answered no Why then said she, belike he is gone, for neither do I see him, then she begun to talk very softly with them, as if no body should hear them, saying, that Smack was with her in the monring when she was in her bed, and told her that this next week will be a marvelous sick week to her, which he could not help, but he did so beat Pluck as he told me, that he will never come at me again, and if ever he comes again, then he saith he will kill him: but he said to me, if you will go to some friends house, and stay there all the week, then you shall be well, and escape this sick week: but I told him said she, that I had no friends house to go unto, nor to none I would go to, do he what he wold, then he willed me to go to Sommersom (which is a town two miles from Warbois) where sometimes she hath bin, with an uncle of hers, since her first visitation in this sort, & bin very well, but I marue said she, how he knows Sommersom, I think he knows all the Country over, but I told him that I would not once stir my foot out of the door for him, do he what he
could.  Then her sisters asked when Smack would come again.  She said, that he told her, that he would come soon at night after supper.  In the mean time certain strangers came in, who were desirous to see her out of her fit, which was done by the charge of Agnes Samuel.  Namely, as she was a Witch & consented to the death of the Lady Crumwell, &c.  At night a little before supper she fell into her it again, & so continued till supper was ended.  When the company were risen from the board, and set by the fire, Smack came to her again, and talked with her about those fits, which she should have the next week, saying that he could not do withal, except she would go from home.  She said that she would not, and therefore willed him to do his worst.   Then said he, when was Catch with you? She told him y Catch was there to day, & threatened to punish her y next week with wonderful sick fits, because he said, y I had caused you to break his leg, but I hope said she, that you will break his neck also, & some body will break yours, for you are all nought.  Smack answered, that he would course Catchfor it, & warrant her that he would never come again to her when he had done with him.  Then said she, tell me when shall my fits begin, & when shall they end?  He said, y on muday next in y morning they must begin, & end that day seven-night in y morning.  You will have a whole week belike (said she) yea said he, it must be so, & you shall be sore in your body y next week after.  On Saturday which was the next day, she had divers fits, and was brought out of them by Agnes Samuels charge, and so likewise on the Sunday.  When Monday came which was the day appointed for y beginning of these troublesome fits, it kept promise with her, for in the morning she wared marvellous sick & evil at ease, having her perfect senses, as it was also foretold that she should have, and so continued all the week: the manner whereof, hereafter shall be declared, because certain accidents worthy the remembrance befell some other of her sisters in this week, which shall first have their place.

Mistress Elizabeth one of these children and before spoken of, was all this week troubled with very sudden and extraordinary fits, for she was twitched and wrong in her body more grievously this week, then she was many months before, which violent passions in her, made us conjecture, that there was some extraordinary matter in working: for it could not be that such violence should continue long, for if it had, it could not but have cost her her life.  And to posse over many matters of strangeness, which befell in that week, we will come to Saturday, which was the tenth of March: on which day as this child sate at supper, it should seem by the manifold signs she made with her hands and head, and by her humming with her voice, that she would fine have spoken to something that stood on the table, but she could not, her mouth was shut up.  Then she began to lament marvelous bitterly a good space, yet could not declare her grief.  Soon after, she fell into a most troublesome fit, which would not suffer her to sit on her stool.  Then the maid Agnes Samuel, was willed to hold her, which she did: and after a while she began to grow more quiet.  And an other of her sisters younger then she, Grace by name, was more troubled than she was, so Nan Samuel let down the one, and took up the other, and as she was holding this Mistress Grace in her arms, the other child mistress Elizabeth that sat hard by her, said on the sudden in a marvelous anger to her, now I can see the young Witch which I could never do before since she came to the house in my fit.  The copany that sate at supper, thought that there was some extraordinary matter in working, that the child should call the young maid Witch, for it was never heard by any body, that ever she gave either her or her mother, any evil word before, either in her fit or out of her fit: presently she said to her, my sister Joins devil told me even now as I sate at supper, that I must scratch the young Witch.  So soon as eve she had said so, she slipped from the bench whereon she sat, and fell upon her kees, for she was not able to stand, and caught the maid by the hand that stood hard by her, holding of her sister, and scratched one of her hands most fiercely to see, with both her hands, and saying that it was she that had bewitched her and all her sisters, and she had been well long since but for her.  O thou young With, O tho young Witch, fie upon thee, fie upon thee, who ever heard of a young Witch before? and thus she cried with such vehemence of speech, and eagerness of scratching, as that both her breath and strength failed her.  When she had breathed a while, she fell upon her again, and said that this was her

sister Joins devil who uses not to lye, that made her to scratch her, for said she, I would not have scratched you, and it was full evil against my will to do it, but the devil makes me to scratch you, stretching forth mine arms, & bending my fingers, otherwise I would not do it, but I must do it, and so must all my sisters scratch you, though they be never so unwilling to do it, as my self now am, these words she uttered and many more, to the like effect, in that time wherein she scratched her.  All this time the maid held the other child in her arms still, never once offering to pluck away her hand from her, but cried out very pitifully, desiring the Lord to think upon her.  Then did one that stood by, demand of her, and willed her to speak her mind as she thought, whether the child did scratch her of her own will and desire or not.  She answered, that she thought she did not, nay saith she, I know she did not, and that it is no part of her will thus to scratch me.  The child when she was weary the second time with scratching of her, on the sudden put forth both her hands, and said look you here, the devil saith, that I must scratch her no more now, for my fingers are thrust forth so straight, that I cannot bend them, and so it appeared that they were, for she held forth her hand, and her fingers were very straight and stiff, then she rubbed her hand upon the maids hand that bled a little, and wiped the blood upon her own hands, and this the child did oftentimes, while she talked with her.  Presently upon the scratching ended, the child began to weep, insomuch that many tears fell from her eyes, and cried marvelous bitterly, and said to the maid, I would not in any wise have scratched you, but the devil made me, and forced me whether I would or not, oh that you never had deserved to be thus used, and her manner of complaining was, as if she had committed some great offence.  When this weeping fit was something assuaged, she began to exhort her, lifting up her voice with such vehemence and desire for her amendment, as that we may verily think, the like was never heard to come forth of a childes mouth.  It is not possible to set down all the words of exhortation she spake unto the maid at that time, but these were some of them, and the very words so near as could be remembered.  Oh that thou had

grace to repent thee of thy wickedness, that thy soul might be saved: for thou hast forsaken thy God, and given thy self to the devil.  Oh that thou did know what a precious thing thy soul was, thou would never then so lightly have parted with it: thou had need to pray night and day, to get Gods favour again, otherwise they soul shall be damned in hell fire for ever.  Thou doest oftentimes pray here at home, when we pray, and likewise at Church, but thou pray in vain, because thou pray not with thy heart: but I will pray for thee with all mine heart, and I will forgive thee, and desire all my sisters, & all my friends to forgive thee, if tho wilst confess thy fault, but thou hast an hard hart (said she) and the Devil holds thy hart and will not suffer thee to confess it, but thou must confess it whether thou wilt or no, when thy time is come.  But oh that thou would now confess it, that thy soul might bee saved.  These words when she used them (as she did often) she would three times at the least repeat them over, with such vehemence, as that it was strange to hear, for she would never leave uttering of them so long as her breath would serve.  Then did she tell my sister Joins devil stands here before my face, and pointed with her finger to the place, and tells me that in despite of thee thou shalt one day confess it, or be hanged, we shall not be well: but if thou would even now confess it, we shall be presently well, defy now therefore the devil, and confess it, that God may forgive thee, and that they soul may be saved.  If thou would think (said she) of the torments of hell, and that thy soul must burned in hell fire, except thou doest confess and repent, then thou would not now stand so stiffly in the denial of it as thou doest: but thou art a wicked child, and thou hast been a Witch this four or five years & more, thou hast done more hurt the to me and my sisters, for tho hast killed my Lady Crumwell and more.  The devil that stands here tells me so, and thou would it have killed my sister Joane in this her sick week, but God will not let thee, what a wicked hart hast thou that nothing will content thee but our death, thou, and thy father (said she) were the cause why thy mother did deny that, which she did once confess, she was in a good way, and would
never have gone from her words, had not you and your father bin, & if your mothers soul be dominated, you & your father must answer for it, with many such like speeches, for your mother (said she) had confessed a truth, and was sorry for her naughtiness, every body had forgiven her, and would have prayed for her: oh that she had never gone home, that her soul might have been saved, thy mother is a witch, thy father is a witch, and thou art a witch, but of all the three thou art the worst.  Thy mother would never have done so much hurt as she hath done, but for thee, and so the devil hath told me, thou wicked child, thou art a wicked child, the Lord give thee grace to confess, and to repent that thy soul may be saved.  Oh that they father were now here, for the devil now saith, that I should scratch him also, he is a witch and a naughty man, Oh that he were here, that he might hear me now speak to him.

Then two of the childes Uncles, M. John Pickering, and M. Henrie Pickering, being there present were entreated of the childes father to see if they could by any means, procure old Samuel to come to the house, but it was thought by the company to be a labour lost before they went, the man was of so churlish a nature, and always so hardly drawn to the house: notwithstanding they went, and when they had gone twenty paces from the house, they did perceive the same man to be cumming alone very fast towards the house, so they agreed to posse by him in silence, to see whether he meant to go, the man went directly to M. Throckmortons house, which they perceiving, followed him back again, and were as ready to go into the house as he, when they were come into the hall, and were even at the door ready to go intot he parlour where the child and other company were: the child said of her self, he is come, he is come, I will go scratch him, so she pressed forwards on her knees (for she had no use of her legs) towards the parlour door as if she would go to him, yet this is most certain, that she was the in such a place of the parlour as that she could not see any part of the hall, and therefore not the man.  Then M. Doctor Dorington being in presence, perceiving the child so to go on her knees, stayed her, and caused the man to be called into the parlour, when he came in, she still pressed to go towards him, and

said I must scratch him, I must scratch him, on the sudden she stopped sayin, I must not scratch him, look you here & showed her hands how her fingers were shut up close together, if he had been here even now (saith she) the devil saith I should have scratched him, but now I must not.  Then M. Thockmorton the childes Father, demanded of the man John Samuel, why he came to his house, he answered that one in the field told him that his daughter was sick and therefore he came.  Then Master Trockmorton and M. Doctor Dorington charged him to tell the truth wh o it was and not to lye, as he would answer it, he answered that he would not tell them, notwithstanding they urged him, at length he said, that his brothers daughter came to his house and told him, that she saw M. Doctor Dorington and M. Throckmortons man come to this house together, and then he thinking that there was some thing to doe about his daughter, came therefore to see the matter, but this was thought of the company to be no sufficient cause to bring him to the house, whereas before he could not be gotten to come without a precept from the Justices.  The child continued still crying out upon him & said, that he was a naughty man, and a witch, and but for him & his daughter, his wives soul might have been saved, and therefore he must answer for it before God one day, and so repeated over again many of her speeches to him, which before she had said to his daughter exhorting him to prayers, and to ask God forgiveness.  The man was so rude in his behaviour, and so loud in his speeches that the child could not be heard for him: His answers to the child were, that she lied, and so did all the company in saying he was a witch, and he said that she had been taught her lessons well enough, and that she was above seven years old (though indeed she was not twice seven) with many such like speeches, and would not be silent nor suffer the child to speak for any thing until he was almost forced unto it by the childes father, although he might perceive very well, as also did all the company, that the child could not hear him, nor answer to any of his speeches, either yet stayed her words at his talking, in any thing she intended to speak to him, although he greatly interrupted the same, if she could have heard him, but she neither heard him nor any
other in the company, yet she saw him and his daughter, and not any other.  Towards the end when the child had thus exhorted the father and the daughter for the space of an hour and an half, M. Throckmorton the childes father, told the man John Samuel, that his daughter Agnes, by a charge which she had, commanded the spirits to depart from his childen, & they had departed, he therefore willed him to use the same words which his daughter before had used, to see what would come of it: he said that he would not, neither should any make him to speak them, and he would not be brought to it for any thing.  Then did Master Throckmorton tell him that seeing he came to his house unsent for, he should not depart until he had spoken them, so long as the child continued in her fit, if it were this week before she came forth.  Then did M. Doctor Dorington (the rather to bring him on) speak the words before him, so did also two or three of his neighbours, honest men in the town, that were then present and saw al these matters in the child, but this would not persuade the man, until in the end, he perceived that Master Throckmorton was resolute, not to suffer him to depart until he had spoken them, then he begun to speak them as he was taught by Master Throckmorton, the words were these, as I am a Witch, and consenting to the death of the Lady Crumwell, so I charge the spirit to depart from Mistress Elizabeth Throckmorton at this present, and to suffer her to be well, the man had no sooner spoken the words, but the child presently arose, and was very well, marvelling to see such company there.  Then was the child asked if she knew of any thing which she had done or said, and diverse particulars were named unto her, but she knew of no such thing, saying that she had been a sleep, and was ready to weep because they charged her with such things, so the company departed, and she went to bed being very well.

It now follows to declare how mistress Join Throckmorton was handled in this present week past, which was that sick week of sitters threatened to her before by the spirit.  On Sunday which was the day before, she was lightsome, and had no fit at all, saying that she was very well, yet no body would tell her of the sick fits which was threatened to befall her the
next day, so she went to bed very merry and cheerful, saying that she ailed nothing at all, she thanked God: The next morning which was Monday, when she awakened there was found a great change in her head and stomach, and that there was some thing under her sides, which did so twitch and wring her, that she could not fetch her breath. All that day, as likewise all that week following she was most strangely tormented, crying out of extreme payne in all her parts of her, her stomach was taken from her, so that she eat all that week scarcely so much as might be thought sufficient to sustain nature, her legs were exceeding sore, and full of pain, having little or no use of them all that week, her hands were continually cold, and benumbed, but her greatest and continual pain lay in her head, which caused her to take marvelous unquiet rest, for she did nothing but cry and groan the most part of the nights throughout that week neither resting her self nor suffering any others to rest, that lay near her: Now besides this general and continual pain in her body, she had divers fits every day, and likewise in the night time, such as wherein no man that saw her, thought she should have escaped with her life: for she would lye upon her bed scriking and suddenly starting an hour together, and sometimes four or five hours without any intermission, otherwiles she would lie as one in a Sown or Trance holding her breath a quarter of an hour and sometimes longer, in such sort as that it could neither be felt nor perceived that she breathed at all for the time, yet in the end she would arise up with her belly and fetch a marveilous deep sigh, and a loud doleful groan as if she had been gasping for her last breath: And this kind of fit was most usual with her night and day, and would hold her the longest of any other, and always the longer when any of her friends or other company stood by and comforted her, some times it would rise up into her head, and their resting a while, it would raise up her body, and her head very strongly, until almost she stood upright, yet with such strength, as that it was not possible for any man to hold her down.  In which fit she was desirous to have her head holden, otherwise she said that it

would rine her head in sunder, and always a little before she felt the fit coming, she would say hold, and all the while she was in rising with her body, it would hold her breath, until she came to the highest, and then would she fetch a great gone, and with a sudden downfall, settle her self in the chair again, and how soever all the week she was in this continual danger and had her life in her hands every hour ready to yield it up, yet on Saturday all the day long, but especially in the night she was in the greatest hazard thereof, for then did her parents, & other that wished well unto her, think that she should never have seen the daylight: such and so many were her extreme fits and dangerous perplerities in that night, but it pleased God, a little before morning to give her some better rest, and this was some good hope, and comfort that her parents and other her friends had in respect in the safety of her life, for that both she her self, and other also of her sisters had heretofore said being in their fits, that Nan Samull would have had the Devil to kill her this week, as she hath done the Lady Crumwell but God will not suffer him.  But in all these extremeities this is most certain, that all the week long she had the perfect use of her senses as the spirit had told her that she should have, and was able to discern one thing from an other, and to make answer to any question that was asked at any time (except then when her breath was stopped and while she continued as one in a sown,) but being asked afterwards if she then heard, she answered that she did always hear, but she could not sometimes speak, because her breath was stopped.  And this was a thing noted in her that week, that she could never abide that Nan Samuel should abide in her company, or come into her sight or once to hear her named, yet she would say, that she could not tell for what cause it was, but it should seem there was some secret matter in it, for whenever, and how long soever, she stayed with her she was always the more strongly dealt with all and the more grievously troubled.

When the sennite was ended, and Monday morning came again, she said that she felt her self reasonable well, and all that day she had no fit at all, only she said, that she was very sore in her body & in her legs, as if she had been beaten with strockes.
All this week following she continued reasonable well, yet not without many fits and great soreness in her legs, especially towards night as it was common with them all to be always worst at night.

On Monday after that which was the 19. of March a little before supper she fell into her fit, and when supper was ended Smack came unto her again, to whom she presently said, I trust God will one day revenge me on you, and all your company, for thus punishing of me and my Sisters: why said he, had you a sick week of it?  It is no matter to you said she: why I told you said he, that I could not help it, except you would have gone abroad to some friends house, go you said she whether you will, and doe what you can, I will not once stir my foot out of doors for your pleasure, for I know you would kill me if you could, and you use all the means you can both to kill me and my Sisters, but I trust God will not give you leave & if he doth I am well contented withal, for I had rather be dead then to live in this continual pain, and not able to stand or go: many more such like speeches they had together; anon she said, you have often times told me, that I should scratch the young witch, before the Assizes, now tell me when shall it be?  For I would fine scratch her, I cannot abide her now of late, whatsoever the matter is, I think God hath set my hart against her, for I cannot eat my meat, if she stands before me, it so goes against my stomach, and yet I cannot tell wherefore, but tell me said she on what day shall I scratch her, he told her that she should scratch her two or three days before the Assizes, tell me said she, on which day shall it be?  For I will never believe you, he told her that it should bee on Monday before the Assisses which was that day fortnight: well said she, look that it be, for I will keep my nails unpared for her, I will scratch on side for my self said she and the other for mine Aunt Pickering, this her Aunt is wife to M. Iohn Pickering of Ellington in the county of Huntington, who was one of the twelve, that were bewitched, and hath been most grievously tormented with pain and breaking out in her legs, as that she is not able to go, well said mistress Join to Smack, I will surely lay it an whenever I scratch her, that all the world may see that
she is a witch: Then said Smack, they that think otherwise of her are deceived, and that I will prove: Will you prove it? Said she, how will you prove it?  By compelling you to scratch her: will you compel me?  Said she, why then I will not scratch her: but you shall scratch her said he: so they had many words about it, in thend she said that indeed she had a good will to scratch her, but yet she will not scratch her if she can otherwise choose, but Smack said that she must scratch her as well as all her other Sisters had done and must doe, for there are yet two behind that must scratch her.  When they had ended their talk, she called for Agnes Samuel and said that she should not come forth of her fit, until she had charged the spirit to depart, which the maid did, and she was presently well.  Within two days after.  Mistress Grace the youngest of all those five sisters, as she sat in the maids arms, in a very troublesome fit, on the sudden fell on scratching of the maids hand, merveilous fiercely to see, but was not able to speak, her mouth was shut up: yet did she groan and weep greatly as if she had been doing of some thing against her will, but such was the childes short nails and want of strength, that she could not once ripple the skin of the back of her hands.  Of this child there are not many things noted, because for the most part her mouth was shut up during the time of her fits, yet had she very many most grevious and troublesome fits: for she hath sit in a chair, or on a stool by the fire side, some times a whole day together, groaning and weeping most lamentable to see, and was never clear from her fits since the first beginning.

On the next Sabboth day which was the 25. of March at night when supper was ended, Mistress Join fell into her fit, as she had many fits that week, but Smack never came unto her to talk until now: So it should seem that he talked with her a good while before she would either seem to listen, or give answer to him, yet it might easily be perceived by her countenance and gesture that some thing talked with her, for she wold turn away her face and shake her head, as if she liked not of it: on the sudden she said go too, if this be true that you say, let us see what you will doe.  So Mistress Join called for her sister Elizabeth who was likewise in her fit, & told her that Smack

was come, and will now tell her many things, before Nan Sa. face: Smack saith she calls her nothing but young Witch to begin withal, belike he is angry with her: Therefore she called for Nan Samuel, and told her that she must be present and hear what Smack will say to her, yet saith she I cannot hear you, but I can see you: By and by she said Smack saith that you must say these words, and I shall presently come forth of my fit, but I shall fall into it again, and shall have many fits to night, and come forth of them again at your speeches, the words which the maid must first speak were these: As I am a witch, and would have bewitched Mistress Join Throckmorton to death in her last week of great sickness, so I charge the spirit to depart and to suffer her to be well at this present: so soon as she had uttered them, Mistress Join came presently out of her fit and was well, and being ready to arise she suddenly fell down into her fit again, so resting a while she said to her, the thing saith that you must say as I am a witch and have bewitched Mistress Pickering of Ellington since my mother hath confessed, so to charge the spirit to depart from me, and I shall be well, for the thing saith (said she) that mine Aunt Pickering should have been well before this time, had not you bewitched her again since your mother confessed.  Alas good Aunt Pickering (said she) what harm have you done to any of them that they should use you in this sort, and with that she fell into bitter weeping for her, in so much that they that stood by could not refrain from tears, when she had done weeping, she willed the maid to use that charge, after which used she was well, but did not long so continue, for she was straight way in her fit again: then said Mistress Join to the maid, the spirit saith that you must say, as I would have bewitched her to death, as I wold have done in her last week of great sickness, so charge the spirit to depart from me, and I shall be well, and presently fall into my fit again, all which was then done, and presently found true: Then said Mistress Join, the spirit saith that you have bewitched all my sisters over again, since your mother confessed, or else they had been now well, and to prove this to be true you must charge the spirit to depart from me as you have be-
witched them all severally, and I must have so many several fits, & come out of them at your several charges, so the maid begun with them one after the other, saying, as I have bewitched Mistress Marie Throckmorton since my mother confessed, so I charge the spirit to depart from you, and after her went to the rest of her sisters: so Mistress Join had four several fits, and came forth of them at iiij.  Several charges (concerning the bewitching of her sisters) which the maid used to her.  Then said Mistress Join the spirit saith that now I must also start and struggle, and be pained in my body as well as my sister Iane is, whenever you (speaking to the maid) shall name God, or Jesus Christ, or any good work, although I cannot hear you, yet he doth hear you, and he will make me start.  Then M. Throckmorton, with others that were then in company, perceiving the spirit to be willing to declare so many things of the maid, willed her to charge the spirit in the name of God, to answer her to certain questions, which she should ask it and not to lye, the maid  gave that charge to the spirit the spirit said to Mistress Join, the young witch (for so he in all this talk and speech, hath called her) charge me to tell the truth in certain questions which she shall ask me: I said Mistress Join, and see that you doe tell the truth, and not lye in any one thing, the spirit answered that he doth not use to tell so many lies, as the young witch doth, which words Mistress Join repeated over after the spirit.  Then said M. Throckmorton to the maid, charge the spirit to tell you in what part of your body Mistress Join shall scratch you, which the maid did, and the spirit said to Mistress Join, the young witch would know in what part of her body you shall scratch her: Yea said Mistress Join, in what part of her body shall I scratch her, the spirit answered you shall scratch her on her face, the right cheek for your self, and the left for your Aunt Pickering of Ellington, then said Mistress Join, I will surely scratch the left cheek well for mine Aunt if that will doe her any good, howsoever I do for my self: yea said the spirit do so, and the young witch were as good to take it patiently at the first, for you shall have your pennyworth of her before you have done: Then the maid was willed to ask the spirit whether her mother would confess at

the Assisex, all that she hath already confessed, the spirit said the young witch asks &c. the answer which the spirit made to this question was, that the old witch would confess all again at the Assizes, if she had no evil counsel, and confess also that this young witch her daughter, is a worse witch then her self, for said the spirit to Mistress Join (which words she did in order repeat after the spirit) when the old witch had bewitched the Lady Crumwell, and would have unwitched her again and could not, she put it to her husband, and bad him help her, and when he could not, he put it to this young witch his daughter, & when she could not help her neither, then she counselled her mother to kill her.  And to prove saith the spirit to Mistress Join, that all this is true, whenever any strangers come to this house before the Assizes, you shall fall into your fit, and you shall have three several fits, and shall come out of them at three several charges by the young witch: the first charge that she must use is, as she is a witch, and a worser witch then her mother in consenting to the death of the Lady Crumwell, so I charge the spirit to depart, and you shall be well: the second is as she hath bewitched Mistress Pickering of Ellington since her mother confessed: and the third is as she would have bewitched Mistress Join Throckmorton to death, in her last week of great sickness, after which you shall be well: So the maid of great sickness, after which you shall be well: So the maid used those three several charges to Mistress Join at that time, and she came forth of three several fits, and presently fell into her fit again.  Then the maid was willed to ask the spirit whether Mistress Join should have these fits before the Lord Judge, if she were carried to the Assizes: the spirit said to Mistress Join, the young witch would know &c. yea said Mistress Join, whether shall I have my fits before the Lord Judge or not: the spirit answered that she should have her fits upon the Assizes day before the Judges, and all the fits that ever she hath had heretofore, then was the maid willed to ask whether Mistress Join should have any more fits after the Assizes, the spirit answered to Mistress Join in the same sort which he used before that she should never have any fits after the assizes, and that neither this young witch, nor her mother, nor any kin of them all should be able to hurt her after the Assizes
day.  Then the maid was willed to ask the same question for her sisters how they should doe after the Assizes, the spirit said that he would not answer that question, saying that her sister Ions spirit should declare that thing, then the maid was willed to ask the spirit how many spirits her mother had at the first, and the names of them all severally, & which every one of the children had at that time troubling of them, The spirit (repeating over the maids words unto Mistress Join) answered directly, that the old woman had nine spirits, and she had them of a strange man, who was now dead, and his name he will not tell: The names of the spirits were these, for after Mistress Join understood the question, then she followed it, demanding her self of the spirit what she thought good: The names of the spirits were these: There was three which were called by the name of Smacks, the 4. Pluck, the 5. Blew, the 6. Catch, the 7. White, the 8. Calico, the 9. Hardname.  Mistress Join Throckmorton had himself, who was the first of the Smacks, Mistress Mary had his cozen Smack, mistress Elizabeth had his other cozen Smack, mistress Iane had Blew, Mistress Grace had White, and the old woman had Hardname still with her in the Jail, and what was become of the rest he could not tell: Then the maid was willed to ask whether the old woman did reward them with any thing or not, the spirit answered that she did reward them every day with blood from her chin, saying father that her chin did once bleed of it self to prove her a witch, when she desired God to show some sign thereof: Then Mistress Join of her self asked the spirit whether the man Iohn Samuel was a Witch or not: The spirit answered that he was a Witch & would be a worse then either this young witch is, or the old witch her mother was, when they two are hanged, for then all the spirits will come to him, and he will doe more hurt then any have yet done, for saith the spirit, he hath already bewitched a man and a woman, and to prove this, if the young witch shall charge the devil to depart from you at this present, even as her father hath bewitched two parties, you shall be presently well, so Nan Samuel did, and mistress Join was well, and fell into her fit again: then mistress Join asked the spirit, who those two

were that the man had bewitched: The spirit answered that he would not tell, except the young witch went out of the parlour for she must not be here, so mistress Join willed Nan Samuel to go out of the parlour, and the spirit said, let her be watched that she doe not hear when she was gone.  The spirit told Mistress Join that it was Chapel and his wife, which two parties were the old mans next neighbours, and were at some variance and contention with him, and did greatly suspect them- selves of such a matter, for they were both of them a little before that time marvelously troubled with bleach, the woman not able to stir her self, and then man was for a fit or two in the same case that these children were in, yet said the thing if Chapel will beat the old witch well, he may peradventure never be more troubled with him.  The old witch said the spirit would once have broken his neck by giving him a fall upon the causye in the street as he met him, for he caused on the sudden both his Patterns to be broken, and if he had fallen on the stones as he fell in the mire, he had been maimed: this last point of Chapels fall was not known to any in the house at that time, and Mistress Join being asked of the same when she came forth of her fit said that she never heard of any such thing: but when it was inquired of Chapel, he confessed that he had once such a fall, as he met with old Samuel in the streets, and both his Patterns were broken at one instant, and because he would not fall upn the causie (for it was but narrow) into the mire, wherein he was marvelously foiled, and if an other neighbor had not been with him, he had been in greater danger.

This tale was told by the spirit to mistress Join, and mistress Join by repeating the spirits words declared to them that stood by, then the maid was called into the parlour again, and willed to ask the spirit, whether Mistress Join should be well in the way that she went to the Assizes or not, and whether she should be better at the Assizes then at home, but it should be worse for the young witch if mistress Join went, and she should be well all the way she went until she had taken her chamber, and then she should fall into her fit: how true all this
fell out, you shall hear hereafter, the spirit told her then again, that she should have three several fits upon the Assizes day, & the young witch must bring her out of them, by three several charges: The first must be as she is a worser witch then her mother in bewitching the Lady Crumwell to death, the second as she hath bewitched Mistress Pickering of Ellington since her mother confessed, and the third as she would have bewitched mistress Join Throckmorton to death in her last week of great sickness: And the spirit said all this is true, and shall be proved true hereafter, and in token thereof you (speaking to Mistress Join) shall be very well all the day to morrow, and have never a fit let the young witch doe what she can, except some stranger come, and then you must have three several fits to prove her a witch, and so you shall have them whenever any strangers come: but this saith the thing of himself (speaking to Mistress Join) you must remember in any case to pare your nails when you have scratched the young witch: why must I doe so said she? because said he, the young witches blood will stick on your nails, and you must burn her blood, least  you be worse afterwards, why said mistress Join, put you me in mind of it if I chance to forget it? so I will said he: then the spirit departed and mistress Join said that she must not come forth of her fit, except Nan Samuel help her out by one of her charges, which she did, and then she went to bed being very well, and the next day continued without any fits at all, neither came there any strangers to the house.  On tuesday following there came M. Doctor Dorington, and with him one of his brothers M. Iohn Dorington a Londiner, presently after their coming into the house mistress Join fell into her fit.  Then did they call for the maid Nan Samuel, and one of the company willed her to say the Lords prayer, and her belief, which she did, and whenever she named God, or Jesus Christ, or the holy Ghost, mistress Join did marvelously start and struggle at it, so that she could scarcely sit upon her stool: and in thend the maid brought her out of her fit three several times, by her three several charges as the spirit before had said.

The next strangers that came to the house were M. Henry Crumwell one S. Henry Crumwell sons, and with him one
of S. Henry his men, and this was upon Thursday following being the 29. of March, when they came into the house Mistress Join was well, but they had not stayed there a quarter of an hover but she fell into her fit, and was very shrewdly handled before them as was also her sister Iane, whenever the maid named God, or Christ Jesus, and in the end, she was brought out of her fit, three several times, by three several charges as before, many strangers in that week came to the house, and she had these several fits as you shall hear on Monday following which was the day appointed for scratching.  Mistress Join fell in to her fit, a little before supper, and so continued all supper time, not being able to stand on her legs, so soon as thanksgiving after supper was beginning to be said, she start up upon her feet and came to the table side, and stood with her sisters that were saying grace, and presently when grace was ended she fell upon the maid Nan Samuel, and took her head under her arms and first scratched the right side of her cheek, and when she had done that now said she, I must scratch the left side for mine Aunt Pickering, and scratch that also until blood came forth of both sides very abundantly, the maid stood stone still, and never once moved to go from her, yet cried very pitifully, desiring the Lord to be merciful unto her, when she had done scratching, Mistress Join let her self upon a stool, and fared as though she had been out of breath, for she took her wind merveilous thick, yet the maid never struggled with her, and was able to hold never a joint of her, but trembled as it had been a leaf, and called for a pair of shears, to pair her nails but wehn she had them, she was not able to hold them, in her hands, so she desired some body to doe it for her, then M. Doct. Doringtons wife who was her Aunt, standing by her took the shears, and paired her nails but Mistress Join her self saved the nails as her fingers were paired and when she had done threw them into the fire, and called for some water to wash her hands, which after she had done, she threw the water also into the fire: when this was done this Mistress Join fell upon her knees, and willed the maid to come and kneel down by her, and to pray with her, they said the Lords prayer together and likewise the Creed, but it should seem, that Mistress Join


could not hear the maid for she would say amiss many times, and then the company would help her out, but Mistress Join did not stay for her, so that she had ended her prayers, before the the maid had half done hers: After this M. D. Dorington took a prayer book, & read certain prayers which he thought good, and when he had done, then mistress Join fell to exhorting of the maid and gave her many good exhortations, and as she was thus in speaking to her fell into a merveilous weeping & sobbed so greatly, that she could not well utter her words, saying that she would not have scratched her, but y she was forced unto it by the spirit as she was thus complaining on the sudden mistress Elizabeth Throckmorton one of her younger sisters being suddenly taken in her fit (for it was not known to any in the company) came hastily upon the maid, and catched her by one of her hands, and fine would have scratched her, saying that the spirit saith, that she must also scratch her, but the company willed the maid to keep her hand from her, which she did, so they strove together a great while, until the child was windless: Then said the child will no body help me, repeating the words twice or thrice, then said her sister mistress Join, being still in her fit, shall I help you sister Elizabeth?  I said she for God sake good sister.  So mistress Join came, and took one of the maids hands, and held it to her sister, Elizabeth, and she scratched it until blood came, and seemed to be merveilous joyful that she had gotten blood, she pared her nails also, and washed her hands and threw all into the fire: After al this before the company departed, the maid helped mistress Join, out of her fit three several times one after the other, by three several charges as you have heard before: And likewise brough mistress Elizabeth Throckmorton out of her fit by saying as she hath bewitched mistress Elizabeth Throckmorton since her mother confessed.

We will now leave mistress Join unto the Assizes day, I retreat a little back again to mistress Iane, who is the youngest of M. Throckmortons children save one, and hath drunk as deep of this cup of affliction as any of all her sisters hath done, and as she first talked of it, so she was the first that disliked, and disclosed the author of it, for she it was that first cried out of mother Samuel, and said that it was she that had bewitch her, before either her parents or any other that came towards her, suspected any witchery et al, since which time as there hath been great cause to think, that whereas she was the first that gave occasion to suspect the old woman, and indeed did her self openly accuse her, so she hath been therefore amongst all the rest, the most extremely dealt withal: for there was never any of her sisters, (mistress Join excepted) y did abide such heavy brunts, such dangerous and mortal temptations, as she hath done, for she hath been often and divers times tempted to cast her self into the fire, and into the water, and to deprive her self of life by cutting her throat with her own knife.  And these things have thus appeared in her, namely, that she hath many times in her fits, suddenly pulled the knife out of her sheath, and if she hath been abroad, she hath thrown it from her so far as she could: if within the house sitting at the table or in any other place, she hath thrown it under the table or in some corner of the house, saying that the spirit doth now tempt her to kill her self, but she will not, desiring the Lord to strengthen her against them, and when she hath come out of her fit, she hath acknowledged no such matter, marvelling who hath taken her knife from her, and for the danger of fire, this thing hath also been proved many times in her: for she hath pressed forwards, and strained her self to thrust her head into the fire, and hath been permitted to come so near the fire with her head and face, that resting only upon the strength of one that did withhold her, had she been let go, she had fallen flat into the fire, to her utter danger of perishing therein, and the same experience in her, hath as often been made by water, saying always that the Devil doth tempt her to both: yet this hath been observed continually in all these temptations that she was never tempted to any of these dangers, (that ever was known) being alone, but always when there were some company and assistance by to help her: which thing thus considered, whether it hath proceeded of the gracious providence and goodness of God, which cannot be denied but that it hath showed it self most strange and most wonderful, both in the preservation of her, as also in the rest of her sisters in these their troublesome extremities, or whether it hath been some secret illusio, and

mockery of the Devil to deceive the standers by, it rests doubtful, and cannot be determined amongst men, but whether one or the other, or whatsoever, god deserves the glory.

 

Upon Friday which was the 15. of march 1592.  This mistress Iane was very much troubled, with her fit

On Friday, which was the fifteenth of March 1592, this Mistress Jane was very much troubled with her fit, sitting at the table in dinner time, as she had been for a fortnight or three weeks before that, more extremely used at meals, then at any other time of the day, for always a little before she should sit down either in giving of thanks, or presently after her fit would surely take her.  On this day as she sat at dinner, she seemed that some thing that sat upon the table, talked unto her about Nan Samuel, for she would listen a while unto it, and then look back with an heavy countenance unto the maid, that stood behind her, shaking her head as if some sorrow were towards.  Now this mistress Iane had been often told, by her other sisters being in their fits, that the spirit had told them, that she should also scratch Nan Samuel before the next Assizes, happen when it should, but she would always make this answer to them, that she would not scratch her, let the Devil doe what he could against her, albeit the spirit had told so much to her self as she had oftetimes said, but she always withstood the spirit in words to his face, saying that she would not doe it: on this night as she sat at supper with the rest of her sisters, she fell into a very extreme fit, bowing and bending of her body, as if she would have broken her back, shaking of her hands, as that she could not hold her knife steadfast & many times, it would thrust it against her arm.  When this fit was ended then the spirit seemed to talk to her again, as it did at dinner, for she used the same manner of gesture to Agnes Samuel that stood behind her as before, and gave rather greater signs of sorrow then otherwise.  On the sudden she arose from the table, and went to the upper end thereof casting, a marveilous heavy, and discontented to look tothe maid, whereby it was perceived that the child had something in her mind that she could not utter (for her mouth was shut up which did greatly dislike her) then the maid was willed to ask her how she did, the child's mouth was presently opened and she made answer to her worse for you, you young witch turning away her face from her, as if she loathed
to look on her.  This was news to the maid to be called young witch at her hand, so she continued questioning with her, as she was willed, but the child turned away her face, and stopped her ear which was next unto her, saying that she could not abide to hear her or see her, then the maid was willed to ask her what the matter was the child answered that the spirit saith that she must scratch her, when must you scratch me saith the maid, presently the childes mouth was shut up that she could make no answer.  Then did the child begin to weep, most lamentable to see, yet so mixed with anger towards the maid, as that often times looking upon her, she should suddenly turn away her face from her, with such a yearning voice, her teeth being set together as if the evil spirit had been whetting and kindling her fury against the maid: cotinuing thus a quarter of an hour the maid was moved to ask again, when she should scratch her, the child answered by signs, for she could hear her, but not speak holding up her finger at (I) and holding it down at (no) so that it easily might be gathered, that she should scratch her presently after supper so soon as grace was said, then the maid asked in what part she should scratch her, she answered by sign, that it should be upon her right hand, which was the contrary hand to that, which her sister Elizabeth had scratched a week before: then M. Throckmorton the childes father caused M. D. Darington, and some other neighbours in the town to be sent for, to whom when they were come he declared what the child had uttered concerning the maid: In this time before they were come together, there was half an hour spent, all which time the child continued marveilous pensive, and heavy, weeping very pitifully, yet often fiercely starting out of the place where she sat, towards the maid, as if she would have fallen upon her before the time, so one of the children being in her fit gave thanks, which so soon as ever it was ended, the child sinking down upon her knees (for she could not stand) fell upon the maid with such fierceness, & rage as if she would have pulled the flesh of her hand from the bones, yet was she scarcely able to race y skin, saying to the maid that the spirit that stands thereby her tells her, that Pluck holds her hart & her hand (meaning the maids) and will not suffer the blood to come.  When the child was weary with scratching, she

breathed & said that she must have an other fit at her: Then D. Dorington moved the people to pray ith him, all which time she kneeled, very quietly, but when prayers were ended she presently fell to work again upon the maid as before, saying these words to her, with tears trickling down her cheeks, I would not scratch you, but the spirit compels me, saying that I must scratch you, as well as my other sisters have done, & as my sister Join also must doe before the Assizes, for this was (if the time be marked) almost three weeks before the Assizes.

The maid at the first scratching, seemed to go some thing from her, but the child followed still upon her knees, saying to her that she were as good to take it now, as at an other time, for she must fetch blood on her, & she must have her pennyworth of her, saying farther, y she knew, that she did now cry, (which indeed she did) but she could not hear her (for so much the spirit told her before) because she should not pity her, when the child was weary and windless she left scratching, & wiped little blood and water together, which came from the maids hand upon her own hands: Then D. Dorington began to instruct the maid, and to exhort her with many good speeches, saying that God would surely not suffer her to be thus cried out upon by these wicked spirits, and afflicted in this sort by these innocent children contrary to their wills, if she were not consenting, or at the least concealing, and of some knowledge of these wicked practices, which her mother had confessed.  The maid very stiffly denied all that could be said, & desired God to show some present token upon her, that they all might know that she was guilty of thee matters: Presently after these words, her nose began to bleed, and she bled very much, which thing whether it were a sign of Gods sending at that time, in token of her giltinesse or not, that he knows only: and man (I think) may without offence greatly suspect.  Yet this she could say being charged with all, that she had bled four times that day before, which thing was very true, bleeding very much every time, always saying that she had not bled so much to her remembrance in seven years before, wishing that this often bleeding would foreshew no evil towards her: In thend the child said, of her self, that the thing which now stands by her

doth tell her, that she must not come forth of her fit, until the old man Iohn Samuel the maids father, shall come and pronounce certain words to her which she must tell him: then was she asked by the maid & others that stood by, what those words should be, but the child could not hear any body: by & by she said of her self, what is her father come into this reckoning now? & shall I never come forth of my fit, until he speak these words, even as he is a witch & consented to the death of the La. Crumwell, so to charge the spirit to depart fro me, & then I shall be well & not before?  I did think even so, said she, that he was as bad as the worst, he looked so ilfavouredly: then M. Throckmorto hearing those words of his daughter, desired M. Henry Pickering the childes uncle, & two other of the neighbours, to go see if they could procure him to come, but he refused to come, so the company for that night departed, & the child went to bed in her fit, & so continued until the Assizes day, as hereafter you shall hear, her father yet not ceasing to send for the man every day, and to go to him himself, yet could by no means procure him to come to his house.  On Sunday following, which was the xviij. of March in the morning, the spirit came again unto her, then said the chld, the thing saith that I should now both hear & see y young witch if she were here (for so y spirits always called her) & see the thing also which I never did before, all of the together, then was the maid called for, & asked the child what the thing saith unto her, she answered that the thing tells her, that now she must start as well as her sister Join both whenever she names God that she must not come forth of her fit, this week nor the next, and peradventure never, until one of these three things come to posse, which are, either your father (speaking unto y maid) must come & speak these words to me, cue as he is a witch, & hath consented to the death of the La. Crumwell: or you must confess that you are a witch, & have bewitched me & my sisters: or el you must be hanged: then the maid was willed to ask the child whether she should come forth of her fit, whenever or wheresoever her father did speak these words to her: then the child asked the spirit, and the spirit answered, that she should and so for that time  the thing departed & she continued in her fit, the manner whereof was as follows, she would fit sometimes in the house all the day


together, as one in a melancholic passion, not speaking to any body, nor desirous of any copany, sometimes again she is very lightsome & merry, and will sport & play with her sisters a great part of the day, yet not hearing nor seeing any body, neither speaking to any particularly, when any passes by her, she will say yonder goes such a coloured gown, I marvel how it goes alone: yonder is a pair of nether stocks of such a colour, or yonder is a hat, a pair of shoes or a cloak, but I can see nothing else.  If one had showed her their hand with a ring on their finger, she would say yonder is a ring hangs in the air, I marvel how it hangs and no body hold it: many will think these matters incredible, but assuredly they are most true.  This thing also was many times proved while those kind of fits continued upon her, that sitting at dinner or supp, she should suddenly have her mouth shut, and if Agnes Samuel had then come, & held a knife to her mouth, & put it betwixt her lips, her mouth should have bin presently opened, & not before, & thus the spirit hath dealt with her 5. or 6. times in a dinner while, & in this fit she continued three weeks wanting one day, for so long it took her before thassises.

To come therefore now to the Assizes day last past on wednesday the 4. of April, Mrs. Joan went to Huntingto, & as she wet upon the way was very well, as she was also all the morning & so continued until within half an hour after she had taken her chamber in the Inn: & then suddently as she sate by the fire she fell into her fit, & having continued so a little space, there came divers up into the chamber to see her, who perceiving that she sate so quietly, would not be persuaded of any thing to be a miss in her: many of them took her by the hand, & spake to her as they thought good, but she neither heard not perceived any thing at all: The some of the copany turned the to the maid Agnes Samuel, who stood by her & came that morning with Mr. Join fro Warboys, & enquiring of her concerning her faith & service of God, she answered that she served God as other people did, when she named God Mrs. Join began to start and struggle with her arms, as if all had not been well, which the copany perceiving, brought her something nearer, & willed her to say y Lords prayer and her belief, which the maid began to do, but before she went half through, the company desired her for compassion sake to stay
her prayers: for the Gentlewoman Mrs. Joan was so grievously tormented in her body as that it set them all in a maze that saw it, and were resolved of that whereof before they stood doubtful, namely that Mistress Join was not in perfect estate: So the company continued their speech to the maid, & ever as by occasion she named God or Jesus Christ, mistress Join started and struggled with her self, shivering & shaking of her arms & sholders in that manner, as that every body perceived easily that it was not possible for any so to doe of themselves, yea and many times when no body noted the name of God to be uttered by the maid, yet would mistress Join put them in mind thereof by her struggling.  And if the maid chanced to double the name of God in her mouth, as to say the God of heaven and earth, or Jesus Christ the son of God, it would not suffer her to sit upon her stool: But when she desired the God of heaven & earth to help her, or Jesus Christ the son of God to be merciful to her, why then it would so strangely torment her, as that they that saw it could not tel whether they should more wonder to see the sight, then lament and pity the Gentlewoman's case, then a Gentleman in the company (well acquainted with those manners) willed the maid to say to mistress Join, my God help you, or my God preserve & deliver you, or the God who I serve defend you and be merciful unto you, which she did, but mistress Join never once moved thereat, but when she was willed again to say Jesus Christ deliver you, or the God of heaven & earth help you, then would she so struggle & groan, as that al the chamber sounded withal.  And this was proved an hundred times that day, before five hundred men at several times, and in the same evening after the Court was broken up, M. Justice Fenner who for that time was Judge alone, had a desire to see mistress Join Throckmorton, then being at the sign of the crown in the Hunt. being the place where the said Judge with a great assembly of Justices & gentlemen met the said Mistr. Join Throck. in a fair Alley, being at that present out of her fit, & perfectly well, & after some speeches made by the said Judge to mistress Join, she fell into one of her ordinary fits, her eyes closed up, shaking her shoulders & her arms stretched out right, ready to fall to the ground, but that she was assisted by her father, & not being able to stand, she was led into an arbor, whether also went both the Judge, & the other company, there they saw the said Mrs. Join grievously tormented most pitiful to behold, many good prayers were made both by the Judge & all the copany, but no case appeared: the the father of the said Mr. Join told the Judge that there was one in the company (naming Agnes Sam.) that if she would say certain words in the manner of a charge, y then the said mistr. Join shall be presently well, a thing desired of all the company, therefore the Judge caused the said Agnes Sam. to stand forward, and to know the charge, which was repeated by M. Throck. father of the said mistr. Join, the words were these: As I am a witch, & a worse witch then my mother, & did consent to the death of the La. Crumwell, so I charge the devil to let mistr. Join Throck. come out of her fit at this present.  But before Agnes Sam. spoke the charge to make some trial in others of the effect thereof, the Judge himself, D. Dorington, M. Throckm & others spake the words of the charge, but the said mistress Join had final ease by their speeches, neither would she come out of her fit, the both the Judge & the other copany made many good prayers & petitions to God, but no amendment appeared, after this Agnes Sam. was commanded by the Judge to make some good prayers to God for the ease of the said mistr. Join, which she did, at which time if the said Agnes Sam. had prayed to God or Jesus Christ, then the said mistress Join was in show more troubled then before, & the reason was foretold by the said mistress Join, & all her other sisters by the spirit, that whenever the said Agnes did use the name of God or Jesus Christ, they should be worse troubled then when any other spake y words, for he that is perfect God almighty will not suffer his name to be used in the mouth of such a wicked creatures, which was then proved true, then Agnes Sam. was commanded to say as I am no witch, neither did consent to the death of the La. Cruwell, so I charge the devil to let mrs. Join come out of her fit at this present, but all this was to no purpose: lastly the said Agnes Sam. was commanded to say the right charge, which was as I am a witch, & a worse witch then my mother, and did consent to the death of the La. Crumwell, so I

charge the devil to let Mistress Join Throckmorton come out of her fit at this present.  These words were no sooner spoken by the said Agnes Samuel, but the said Mistress Join Thorkmorton wiped her eyes and came out of her fit, & made low renerence to the Judge, and so she remained about half a quarter of an hour, and then she fell into an other kind of fit, first shaking one leg & after the other, then one arm & after the other, & then her head & shoulders, with other extraordinary passions, to the great grief of them that were present: but the Judge greatly lamenting the case.  When both he and many others ha dmade some good prayers (and finding no ease) caused the said Agnes Samuel to repeat another charm, vx. As I am a Witch & would have bewitched to death Mistress Join Throkmorton in her last week of her great sickness, so I charge the Devil to let Mistress Join come out of her fit at this present: which words being said by the said Agnes Samuel, the said Mistress Join was presently well.  Then the Judge asked her where she had been: She anuswered, I have been a sleep.  I pray God, said the Judge, send you no more such sleeps.  Soon after, she fell into one of her other ordinary fits, with a most strange & terrible kind of neesing, and other passions, the which was so vehement & pitiful to be heard, that it moved all the company at one instant, to pray to God to save her, fearing that her head would have burst in sunder, or her eyes start out of the same, so that the Judge made small delay, but caused the said Agnes Samuel to speak the other charm, which was, As I am a Witch, and did bewitch Mistress Pikering of Ellington, since my mothers confession: so I charge the Devil, to let Mistress Join come out of her fit at this present: which words being spoken, presently the said Mistress Join was well as ever she was in her life, & so hath continued without any grife or fits till this day.  The Lord be thanked therefore.

The next day being Thursday in the morning, there were three several Inditements made, and delivered to the great Inquest, whereof the one was against old father Samuel, old mother Samull, and Agnes their daughter, for bewitching unto death the Lady Cromwell, late wife of Sir Henry Cromwell of Finchingbrook in the county of Huntington Knight, contrary to Gods Laws & the statute made in the rb. year of the Queens Majesties reign that now is &c.  The other two Inditements were framed upon the said statute for be-

witching of Mistress Join Throckmorton, Mistress Iane Throkmorton & others, contrary to the said statute.  The Inditements being delivered to the grand Jury, the evidence was given them privately, by Master Dorington Doctor of Divinity, and Parson of the town of Warboyes aforesaid, by Gilbert Pickering of Tichemersh in the County of Northampton Esquire, by Robert Throckmorton Esquire, father of the the said children, by Robert Throckmorton of Brampton in the said County of Huntington Esquire, by Iohn Pickering and Henry Pickering gentlemen, & by Thomas Nutt Master of Art, and Vicar of Ellington.  The grand Jury made no great delay, but found them all guilty.  And about eight of the clock, the evidence by the forenamed gent. was openly at large delivered in the Court, to the Jury of life and death: & with great patience of the Judge, it was continued till one of the clock in the after noon.  So many of these proofs, preseumptions, circumstances, & reasons contained in this book, was at large delivered, as that time would afford, which was five hours, with out intermission or interruption, until both the Judge, Justices, and Jury said openly that the cause was most apparent: their consciences were well satisfied, that the said Witches were guilty, & had deserved death: and therewithal the gent ceased to give any further evidence.  And this as no small thing is to be remembered, that Mistress Iane Throckmorton on Friday the xvi. of March last past being in one of her accustomed fits, said that the spirit told her, she should never come out of her fit, until old father Samuel had said these words: As I am a Witch, &  consented to the death of the Lady Cromwell, so I charge the devil, to suffer Mistress Iane to come out of her fit.  And this she published openly in the hearing of many : therefore her father sought means, both by himself and others, to have Iohn Samuel come to his house to the child, but they could not prevail: wherefore the said Iane continued in his senseless fits with many pangs and vexations in every part, as they are before described, from the said xvi. of March, till the fourth of April, which was three weeks wanting a day: which day also the said Mistress Iane was brought to Huntington, and there in her fit, was set in the Court before the Judge, where many questions were demanded of her, but she answered to none, for the devil would not suffer his co speak: her eyes were open, yet such a mist was before them, that she neither knew, neither did see his



father, which was next her, and divers of his uncles and friends.  Then the Judge caused old Samuel to be brought from amongst the other prisoners to the upper barr: ne'er unto the place where the clerks sate: where also stood the said Iane. (And the Judge being before told, that if old Samuel would speak the words before recited, the said Iane should be well.)  The Judge therefore asked him, whether he by any means could cause the said Iane to come forth of her fit, who denied the same.  Then the Judge said, as he was informed, that he the said Samuel had a charm made of certain words, which if he would speak them, the child should be well: therefore the Judge recited the charm, and willed him to speak the words, but he refused the same and said, I will not speak them.  The Judge persuaded him, and entreated him, insomuch that the said Judge, the rather to incorage the said Samuel, spake himself openly the charm, so did also master Doctor Dorington, and others then present (by the Judges appointment:) yet he refused the same.  Many good and goly prayers were openly made to God both by the Judge and others, for the case of the child: whereat the child seemed nothing to be moved.  Then the Judge willed Samuel to pray unto God for the comfort of the Child, which he did, but when he named God or Jesus Christ, the childes head, shoulders, & arms were sore shaken, and in show more troubled then before.  Then the Judge said, y if he would not speak the words of the charm, the court would hold him guilty of the crimes whereof he was accused: & so at the length, with much ado, the said Samuel (with a loud voice) said in the hearing of al that were present: As I am a Witch, and did consent to the death of the Lady Cromwell, so I charge the devil to suffer Mistress Iane to come out of her fit at this present.

Which words, being no sooner spoken by the old Witch, but the said Mistress Iane, as her accustomed order was, wiped her eyes, and came out of her fit: and then seeing her father, kneeled down, and asked him blessing, and made reverence to her uncles that stood near her: which before she toke no show of knowledge: and wondering said: O Lord, father where am I? For that as it seemed she neither saw nor heard before, nor knew how she was brought into such a presence.  Then the Judge said: you see all, she is now well: but not with the music of Dauids harp, alluding to the place of Scripture, where King Sale being vexed by an evell spirit received comfort and help when David



played on his harp before him.  Then the confession of old mother Samuel (before specified) made the 26. day of December 1592 last past at Burkden, before the reverent father in God William Bishop of Lincoln, was openly red: So also was read  the confession of the said mother Samuel made at Burkden before said the 29 day of December 1592 before the said reverent father in God. William Bishop of Lincoln, France Cromwell, & Richard Tryce Esquires, Justices of her Majesties peace within the county of Huntington, which also is before specified.  After these confessions red, and delivered to the Jury, is pleased God for the further proof & overthrow of these wicked persons to rear up more witnesses at that time unexpected, who spake some things of their own knowledge, and some of the report: the first was Robert Poulter vicar & Curate of Brampton aforesaid, who said openly that one of his parishioners called Iohn Langley, at that instant being very sick in his bed, had told him, that one day he being at Huntington at the sign of the crown, did in the hearing of old mother Samuel forbid Mister Knowles of Brampton aforesaid, to give her any meat, for that she was an old Witch: and thereupon in the afternoon, as he went from Huntington to Brampton, having a good horse under him, he presently died in the feilde: and within too days after, by the providence of God, he did escape death, twice or thrice very dangerously: and though it pleased God, not to suffer the devil to have the maistry of his body at that time, yet presently after, he lost as many good and sound Cattle to all men judgements, as were worth twenty marks: himself, not long after, in body extraordinarily handled.  And the same night of the day of Assizes, as after it proved true, the same Iohn Langley died.  Also the forenamed Master Robert Throckmorton of Brampton, (which before had given some evidence against the said Witches in the childrens behalf,) now he spake for him self, that he likewise at Huntington and in other places having dealt very roughly in speeches with the said mother Samuel: On Friday the tenth day following, had one of his two year old beasts dyed: and on Sunday next after another beast of the same company and like age died also.  The next week after on Friday, he had a yereling Calfe died, and the next Sunday following, he had an other calfe of the same company & like age died also.  The next week after, Friday he had an Hog died, and the next Sunday after, he



had a Sow having ten Pigs sucking on her died also.  Whereupon advice was given him, that whatsoever thing next died, to make a hole in the ground, and burn the same.  Likewise the fourth week on Friday he had a very fair Cow worth four marks died, & his servants made a hole in the ground and buried the same Cow in it, & threw faggots and fire on her, & burnt her: and after that, all his cattle did well.  Of this last matter, mother Samuel being examined the night before her execution, she confessed the bewitching of the said Cattle, in manner and for me as is declared.

Then the Jailer of Huntington gave this evidence, That a man of his finding mother Samuel very unruly whilst she was prisoner, at a time chained her to a bed-post: wherefore, not long after, his man fell sick, and in all respects was handled as the forenamed children were, with heaving up & down of his body, shaking his arms, legs, & head, having more strength in him in his fits, than any two men had, crying out of mother Samuel, saying that she did bewitch him: and thus remaining in this extradordingary course of sickness, about five or six days after died.

The said Jailer said also, that not long after the death of his servant, he had one of his sons fell sick, and was for the most part handled as his servant before named was: so that it was most apparaut that he was bewitched:  therefore the said Jailer went into the Prison, and brought mother Samuel to his sons bed-side, and there held her, until his son had scotched her, and so presently his son amended.  And to draw to some end, the Jury of life and death, in the afternoon, found all the Inditements Bill vera, which when old father Samuel heard, he said to his wife in the hearing of many: A plague of God light upon thee: for thou art she that hath brought us all to this, and wee may thank thee for it.

Then the Judge grew to sentence, and asked old father Samuel what he had to say for him self, why judgment of death should not be pronounced on him: Whereat he answered, that he had nothing to say, but Lord have mercy on him.  Then the Judge asked old mother Samuel what she had to say for her self, to staye Judgement: Whereat she answered, that she was with child: which set all the company on a great laughing, and she her self more than any other, because as she thought, there should (for that cause) no
judgment have been given.  Her age was near fourscore, therefore the Judge moved her to leave that answer: but in no case she would be driven from it, till at length, a Jury of women were impanelled, and sworn to search her: who gave up their verdict, that she was not with child, unless (as some said) it was with the Devil, & no marvel: for after she was found guilty, there went the forenamed Master Henrie Pickering unto her where she stood amongst the prisoners, to persuade her to confess the truth, and amongst other things she confessed, that the forenamed William Langley, who gave unto her the Spirits, had carnal knowledge of her body, when she received them.  Some are of opinion, that it was the Devil in mans likeness.

After all this, the Judge asked Agnes Samuel the daughter, what she had to say, why judgment of Death should not be given her.  At which time, there was one (being a prisoner) standing by her, that willed her to say that she was also with child.  Nay, said she, that will I not do: It shall never be said, that I was both a Witch and a whore.  And so the Judge after very sound and divine council given severally to them all, proceeded to judgment, which was unto death.  The next day, certain godly men went to the prison to persuade the condemned parties to repentance, and to confess their sins to the world, and crave pardon at Gods merciful hands: at which time, mother Samuel being asked, by Master Iohn Dorington Esquire, one of her Maisties Justices of the Country of Huntington, whether she did not bewitch the Lady Cromwell?  She said no forsooth, I did not.  Then her husband old father Samuel standing behind, and hearing ber deny the same, said, deny it not, but confess the truth: for thou did it one way or other.

The confession of the old woman Alice Samuel, unto certain questions that were demanded of her, by master Doctor Chamberlain, at the time and place of her execution being upon the ladder.

First, being demanded what the names of those Spirits (wherewith she bewitched) were called, she said, they were called Pluck, Catch, and White, the which names she often repeated. Being asked, whether she had bewitch the Lady Cromwell to death or


not she answered, that she had.  Being asked with which of her Spirits she did bewitch the said Lady to death: She said, with Catch.  And being demanded for what cause she did it: She answered: For that the said Lady had caused some of her hair and her haire-lace to be burned: and  that she said, Catch willed her to be revenged of the said Lady: and that thereupon the said Mather Samuel willed him go and do what he would. And being asked, what Catch said to her when he came back again: She confessed that he said, that he had been revenged of her. Moreover, she confessed and upon her death did say for truth, that she was guilty of the death of the Lady Cromwell. Being demanded, whether she had bewitched Master Throckmortons children: She confessed, that she had done it. Being asked, with which of her Spirits: She said, that it was Pluck. Being asked, what she said to him, when she sent him about that matter: She confessed, that she willed him: go torment them, but not hurt them. Being asked, how long they should be in that case: She said, she could not tell: and that she did not seen Pluck since Christmas last. Being asked, what she did with White: She said, that she never did hurt with him: and that she had sent him to the Sea, and that he had sucked upon her chin, but the other two had not any reward. And likewise she confessed, that she had those Spirits of one, whose name (she said) was Langley: where he dwells, she knew not. And for that her husband would not confess any thing of the witchcraft at the time of his death, nor of the privity of himself or his daughter, as accessories to the same: It was demanded of her, whether her husband was privy to the death of the Lady Cromwell or not: She answered, he was.

Being demanded whether her husband was a Witch, or had any skill in witchcraft: she said, he had, and could both bewitch & unwitch: but touching her daughter, she would in no sort confess any thing, but fought by all means to clear her. And for her daughter, her self, she confessed nothing at all touching the witchcraft, but being willed by Master doctor Chamberlain to say the Lords prayer and the Creed when as she stood upon the ladder ready to be executed, she said The Lords prayer, until she came to say, But deliver vs from evil, the which by no means she could pronounce: and in the Creed, she missed very much, and could not say, that she believed in the Catholic Church.


After the execution was ended, and that these three persons were thoroughly dead, the Jailer (whose office it is to see them buried) stripped off their clothes, and being naked, he found upon the body of the old woman Alice Samuel, a little lump of flesh, in manner sticking out, as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an inch, which both he and his wife perceiving, at the first sight thereof, meant not to disclose, because it was adjoining to so secrete a place, which was not decent to be seen. Yet in the end, not willing to conceal so strange a mattee, and decently covering that privy place a little above which it grew, they made open show thereof to divers that stood by.  After this, the Jayors wife took the same teat in her hand, and seeming to strain it, there issued out at the first, as if it had been beesenings (to use the Jailers word) which is a mixture of yellow milk and water. At the second time, there came out, in similitude as clear Milk, and in the end very blood it self. For the truth of this matter, it is not to be doubted of any: For it is not only the Jailers report unto all that require of him: but there are forty others also in Huntingtonshire of honest conversation, that are ready to confirm the same upon their own sight.

And thus ye haus the story of these three Witches of Warboyes, so plainly and briefly, as may be delivered unto you. If any be desirous to know the present estate of these children, howe they are & have been since the death of these parties: you shall understand, that since their day of execution, not any one of them have had any fit at all: neither yet grudging or complaining of any such thing, but have all of them been in as good estate, and as perfect health as ever-from their birth. Gods blessed name be evermore praised for the same. Amen.
