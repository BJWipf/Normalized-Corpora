TO HIS SINGULAR good friend and loving Countrymen, Master Robert Handley Citizen and Grocer of London and Merchant Venterer into the Countries of Spain Richard Galis wishes long life and prosperity to the pleasure of God and his souls health.
AFter I was given to understand of your safe return from Spanish soil (most deer and singular good Friend) and of your happy arrival here into this City, I was often in hart more desirous, then in effects any vviaesable, with some small toke of my good will to gratulate your welcome home, and to the intent I might not be touched with that odible vice of Ingratitude (a vice of all men most to be detested) I imagined many times with my self which way I might best frame mine hability, by using some part of renuneration for your manifold courtesies (as we upon my self as for my sake upon my Friends employed) to avoid the same, amongst which my cogitations this handful of scribbled and banerpapers containing the wonderful and most strange cruelty of Elizabeth Stile alias Rockingham and her associates lately at Abingdon rewarded with the guerdo due for their demerits, came to my mind, which after I had finished albeit at the first deeming them unworthy of dedication to any: yet at the last incensed with the natural instinct of your gentle disposition I was emboldened (the rather for that that you your self have tasted of their cup of displeasure) to commend the same being the first fruits of my labour to the gathering of your loving hands thereby outvvardly to show what the invvarde hart desires if ability did not want, hoping that with the most renovvmed Persian King Artaxerxes you will friendly vouchsafe thakfully to receive this handful of cold water, the entire cognisance of my willing mind, offered unto you, desiring you as leisure may serve you thorovvly with your friends to peruse it, by revolving whereof if you find any delight, gently to think of the vvriter who vvisheth you increase of health, vvelth and felicity until the tie that Atrapos shall cut of the thread of this your mortal life and that after you have passed the pace and run the race of this short voyage and journey and of this brittle frail and inconstant life yovv may be placed, sociated, knit and comined in that glittering light and blissful life of that celestial Jerusalem amongst the company of heavenly Souls and holy minds which do enjoy the life that only may be called life and only Emir invincible.


 Your assured Friend in the Lord Richard Galis.




AS thou hast all ready most (gentle Reader begun to satisfy thy greedy eyes with the friendly survey of the late confession of Elizabeth Stile alias Rockingam, comprehending not a handful to the number of their devilish pageats played. So persevere still I beseech thee with no less good will to peruse this true edition for thy sake and contention only set forth describing the strange, cruel and diabolical tyranny practised through the little regard and great negligence of Magistrates in these our days winking at ye faults of the Offenders which neither regarded the pitiful plaints of the tormented, nor the continual plagues of the Tormentor powered out day by day upon their honest and innocent Neighbours, some bereft of life, some of their wits and some of the natural course of their limbs.
Amongst which I being one of the least that suffered most and oftenest went to ye pot, thought it good to set forth some part both of mine own troubles and of divers others for thy behoof, in reuoluig whereof, if iro my hands thou expect for my philed phrase or learned stile being but misled up in a homely country Cabin where the practise of the stayle and whip more riper

is then lernings lore, thou shalt greatly be deceived. But if a plain Shepherds tale neither profane or fained, oftener occupied in the tarbox and sheephook, Instruments more fit for me then either pen or inck may serve thy turn: receive thy desire. Employ therefore thy pains in perusing the same, and if any thing thou find that either presently cotenteth thy mind or that herafter prove to thy proffit: give thanks to them (and not to me) at whose instance I framed the same, which do on in requital of my pains: I have that which I doo expect. Thus farewell gentle Reader.

 The first attempt of Elizabeth Stile alias Mother Rockingam and her confederates Witches executed for their offences the twentiesix day of February last past practised against the Author.
BEING AT Diverse and sundry times grievously vexed, troubled and tormented as well in Body as in Mind, some times in my raging fits detesting & abhorring all Company, eftsoon again earnestly desiring the same, I often Imagined with my self what strange disease and grief it should be that so should (being whole in Body and not overcharged with sickness, although exempt of perfect remembrance) abate my flesh and weaken my Body, and lying in my bed forworne with unquiet rest, heavy with over much watchig, & desirous to vaquish my pains by taking a little sleep: suddenly about twelve a clock in the night a shodowe of a huge and mighty black Cat, appeared in my Chamber, which ye more as she approached near my bed side: so much the more began my here to stand upright, my hart to faint, and my pains more and more to increase, in so much I was constrained to call for my Fathers Maid, to vring a Candle, whereby I might more clearly behold mine Enemy which did so euelly entreat me, which Maid, being entered into my Chamber: I willed to look for ye Cat, but she was not to be found, neither could the light which she brought continue burning, at which strange sight being amassed: the Maid being gon to bed again,




and I left tumbling and tossing in my bed, more like to dye then any longer to live, my sheets wringing wet with sweat caused through this sudden fear, I called at the last to my remembrance a Brother of mine named Iames Galis who about the Age off fifteen years falling out with one Mother Dutton one of the hellish brood, and at that time suspected to be in that indeed which afterword she proved was in like sort taken in his bed, and bereft of his wits, which until this day are not his own still crying away with the Witch away with the Witch, I forewith conjectured that the same Cat which so amazed me, was either some Witch or of some Witches sending and that my pains before and at that instance sustained was by some Witch practised upon me. Whereupon knowing that prayer in all troubles and extremities was the chiefest string whereon each true Christian ought for to strike, I took my prayer book wherein was contained as well wholesome and godly prayers as psalms, and with the brackish tears distilling from the fountains of my eyes, I sometimes red therein, and sometime again singing Psalms to the honour and glory of God which had vouchsafed of his mere mercy and goodness to strenghthen me in this my afflictions, utterly from the bottom of my hart detesting and having in defiance all the crew of devilish Enchanters, whereof England at this day doth abound. Persuading my self that God being my helper, buckler and defence, neither any Witch nor all the Devils in hell (were they in number as many as the sands in the Sea could have once power to hurt me, all this while not forgetting Iob whose faith no plague, no grief pain, nor vexation, that ever Satan by Gods sufferance might over charge him with could not


any wise remove, thus as I have said, spending & contriving weary and painful night in prayer, Aurora began to show her self, whose crystal clearness as it appeared: so began my pains to surcease, & I to be exonerated of the burden thereof, which when I felt: I caused forthwith the Bible to be brought me, and incontinently I trurned to the before remembered history of that just man Job, of whose steadfast faith and mild patience when I had read and read again, such strength in the Lord did so abound in me, that after that time all the plagues, mischiefs and torments practised by the said hellish Hags against me could not afray me.

How the Author occasioned to walk to Cluevvorth met with Mother Dutton whom he (least thinking on) brought to VVindsore before the Magistrates which without any examination set her at liberty.
Recovered of my griefs and by Gods divine providence restored by little and little to my former health, bearing yet in mind some part of the said Mother Duttons dealing used upon my said Brother Iames, and after that upon my self, I determined hap what hap might, when convenient leisure might serve to bring the said Mother Dutton to Windesore, before the Magistrates there, to the intent if otherwise she could not purge herself the better of that wherewith she should be charged: she might receive such condign punishment as for such Offenders by the laws of ye Realm was due and provided. Which determination as it was then remembered: so in process of time was it forgotten, till it fortunate that walking one day after dinner to walk to Cluewoorth about certain my affairs which I had there to doo: she met me full in the face, whose sudden meeting remoouing my former intent then set in obliuio: caused me furiously to lay hold upon her arm, by the which without many words given I brought her to the hall a prison in Windesor desiring the keeper thereof surely to keep her in his custody until commandment were given him by the




Magistrates to the contrary which he denied to doo without some special warrant from ye Mayor or the Justice for his discharge, whereupon I led her before Master Richard Readforth at ye time Mayor of Windesor desiring him as he was true Officer to God and to his Prince to give his warrant to the Jailer for the better save keeping of this Witch here brought by me before him, who for her devilish Sorceries and enchantments cruelly practised upon divers honest men deserves not to live, affirming that if I could not prove her by sufficient trial to be a weed worthy of plucking up: I would receive such punishment as might be to all (attempting the like either against man or woman) a good ensample but he being belike as a great number be now a days ye more pity, and I would to God it may be amended, mistrusting her devilish practises and fearing least some mischief might succeed his correctio either to him or his, altogether forgetting his oath and duty towards God and his Prince, for the due punishment of Offenders in yt case had & provided commanded??ded me yt without further delay I should let her go, which forthwith I did no less bewailing her liberty then lamenting the lack of better Magistrates to weed out such Malefactors.





How the said Mother Dutton after her delivery from the Authors hands by the Mayor, practised with her Associates his ouerthroovve.
AFter this pestilent Witch was set at liberty, she with her Confederates perceiving the little regard the Magistrates appointed to minister Justice, for the punishment of vice had of the complaints made and put up against the and greatly encouraged thereby, ceased not now to practise all kind of means to vex, trouble and molest me which because of my steadfast faith in God they could not by the selves nor by their wicked spirits execute the same upon me, they stirred up others to be their cruel ministers in the same.

 First procuring my Friends whom Nature linked in the league of love and Friendship utterly to detest me, shamefully to use me, and that which grieved me most maliciously to envy me, in such sort and so long that I often times wished exchange of my life for a most hasty and speedy death, thus living there in exile where reason would I should have been most of all succoured, hated of all without cause, and loved of few, it chanced that a Friend of mine Master Robert Handley (before rehearsed) who at that time for recreation sake making his abode at a house of his in the country was likewise bewitched in his limbs so that he was not able to go, who suspecting his griefs to come by witchcraft, caused me to be sent for partly for Friendships sake which always hath been equal betwixt vs, and partly to use that by my means which he him self by reason of his griefs could not put in practise, to whom when I was come after a little talk had, he told me that he doubted very much least he was bewitched, wherefore (quoth he) good R. Galis, if any spark of Friendship hath ever been kindled betwixt vs: I pray: thee to fetch me a Witch, at whose sight, hope persuades me I shall find ease. At which words being indeed greatly moved: inwardly (as one who loved his entire Friend)




bewailing my Friends troubles more then my own, I wet forth with out any word speaking, and amongst the crew of these helhounds I gat me and within one half hour after God being my help: I brought four before him, whose names ensue, videllicet Audrey the Mistress, Elizabeth Stile allias Mother Rockingham, Mother Dutton and Mother Devil, all which four I caused to kneel down before the said Master Handley and one Master Henry Bust Student in Physic (charging them holding a good cudgel over their backs) as ever they would posse thence a live, not only to tel what the said Master Handley ailed: but also to ease him of his grief, to whom they replied using many excuses, that they neither could tel him his desease much less to help him thereof.
Then going about to know how they had spent their time in the service of God: I examined them in the Lords prayer, the belief and the ten Commandments, wherein I found them (to my great grief) as blind as a beetle and as wise as a Calfe, then demanding the cause of their negligence therein, they replied that since they were borne they were never taught them, neither could they find any that would instruct them therein, and therefore it was to harde for them upon so short a warning to answer unto my objections, which replication when I heard, sorry for their time so ill employed: I drew my purse and gave each of them a penny, charging them as they loved their own souls health: diligently to learn the least that they come to so ill end, for (said I) it can not other, wise be but that for want of the one ye must love the other and for the lack of the grace of God, the love of his holy word and commandments: ye must needs serve the Devil your Lord and Master, and there withal I bad them in God his name to depart, and in short space after my Friend Master Handley came to his old course I mean to his former health.


How the same four VVitches after their departure from Master Handley his house wrought the Authors imprisonment and of his torments suffered during the time of his being in hold.




WHen these four loving Sisters were departed from my Friends house, being of me no other wise entreated or used then you have heard, misdeeming (and not without good cause) that I would work their overthrow in time if I might be suffered, they sought by prison to a bridge my days, and because they themselves would be blameless and void of suspicion, not contented with my pains passed being now hated, abhorred and as it were spitted at of all men, and especially of my own Parents & natural Brethren and brought even to ye very break of desperation (had not God of his infinite mercy and goodness with his mighty hand held me up giving me a great patience worthy to suffer his cross laid upon me for my offences) they caused their Familiars without the which they could not doo any thing, to stir up and against me to licence the Mayor and Burgesses of the town of Windesor (whereof my father whilst he lived was a chief member) who without any office committed, any hurt pretended, or complaint made against me, clapped me up in Prison fast locked in a deep dungeon, into the which I was let up and down with a rope laden with as many gyves and manacles as either my legs could cary or my hands be able to bear, there to remain without bail, until their further pleasure were therein had, a cruelty more worthy for a traitor or a murderer then for any true subject to God & to his Prince. After I was thus enclosed in ye dark, deprived of all human company, refused to have any bed for my money, or liberty of the Prison upon good and sufficient bond, I then began to mistrust my self, and feared the sudden loss of my life, which easily then might have been deprived and with some surmised tale easily answered to the world, though not hid from the face of the Lord, nevertheless emboldened by the mighty help of God to cast away all fear and patiently to suffer my troubles: I ceased not according to my accustomed use and to my great comfort and consolation, to sing to the honour and praise of God the forty one the forty two and the three and forty Psalms, beginning The man is blessed that careful is the needy consider. &c. during thexecution of which cruelty: a pittieful sound of groaning voice opened



the gates of mine ears, and presently my yros which before by workemas cunning were riveted on, making a wonderful great noise much like to a Smith working of his mettle, fell of of my legs, & I taken in so strange a case by the space of two hours, that I thought ye soul forthwith would have left the chariot of my mortal body. But still persevering in my prayers, I ceased not to call upon the Lord, not only for my deliverance: but also that it would please him to turn the hearts of them which had so unjustly used their correction upon me. In the morning when it was day, being not called to mine answer: I desired that I might be permitted to have some coference with Master Doctor Day Deane of the Castle royal of Windsor, or with Master Doctor Wicham of the same Chapel, prebende men of great wisdom and learning, to thentet I might (with their opinions) be fully resolved of that which gnawed my conscience, which by no means I could obtain, but within two days after called to my answer before the Mayor and his brethren, and examined of my irons falling of, I told them as before is declared, who having nought else to charge me with, gave order for my deliuerace, using with such extremity their like power upon me more then a score of times, which here to express would be to long, and more tedious to the Reader, so that I was forced of my self to weave the web of mine own banishemet, rather desirous to live amiddes the deserts of Lybia among the Savage and wilde beasts then in Windsor with my parents and kindred.

How by the help of Sir Henry Neuell Knight, Master Richard VVarde Esquier, and other Gentlemen of worship, the author gat leave to posse the seas into Flaunders, where for a time he served under Captain Morgaine.
FInding here in native soil no place of rest to shroud my careful head but only an ugly dungeon without light or comfort, no refuge succour or help, but that which strau??gers imparted unto me, I imagined daily with my self what were best for me



to do to avoid these troubles daily more & more increasing. Sometimes musing upon this, sometime upon that, now devising one thing, then by and by an other, the lamentable estate and subversion of the lowe country in Flau??ders, came to my mind, whereof a while considering, I determined to address my self towards that coast, there to spend (if not the remainder of my days) yet at the least some part of my youthful years in the service of some one Gentleman or other. Nothing doubting, but that God knowing mine innocence and the righteousness of my cause, would not only prosper my attempt: but also give me happy success to the end of my travails. Upon the which point being fully persuaded, loath without licence. First of my dear father had and obtained to depart (nevertheless his unkind dealings considered) I bended my steppes to the worshipful Sir Henry Neuell Knight, who with Master Richard Ward Esquier, by way of humble petition, I moved to talk with my father about the premises, at whose importunate and earnest perswasios being overcome, granted their requests, whereof being advertised joyful to see my desire take his effect, what haste I made to set all things in order for my travail, let the judge that have tasted the like distress. In fine armed at all assays to countervail my journey before pretended, and ready pressed to set forward on my way, a double sorrow began to combat with in me, and therewithal a doubtful imagination. The one willing me to cease travail and enjoy the presence of my tender parents, and loving companions no less careful of my health then my self, the other encouraging me to avoid the daily assaults of my adversaries by changing the soil to submit my self into the hands of Lady Fortune. Thus traversing in doubtful doubt, now musing on the one, then thinking on the other, and troubled beyond all measure, what were best to be done: I paused me a while. At the last overcome with desire to proceed on my journey: I determined to put my self to ye mercy of Aeolus puffing blasts and to the merciless waives of Neptunes swelling Seas.
The next day bidding my Friends and Country farewell, I trauiled toward London, and from thence I shipped my self




into Holland whether being safely arrived good hay so fell out on my side that before I had spent a day or two in seeking best for my advantage, I found unlooked for of Master William Morgan Gentleman such gentle entertainment that I employed all my enduour to augment my credit with him, under whom I spent some time on the land, some times on the seas as occasion served as the Soldiers life desires not rest in one place, half a years service.

How his Captain leaving the Country the Author was pricked with a loouely motion to his native Country to make return to his Father, who upon his submission received him again.
THe vprores a little before rife in Holand and in all the Countries there about, by valiant prowess of martial Knights suppressed: my Captain (leaving the Country) gave me occasion to think of my Friends in England in the midst of all mine Enemies not forgotten, which for to see an earnest desire kindled my breast, and vanquished with love and duty had towards them, I made my return again to Windesor, more to recosile my self to my deer father to who before my departure I gave some occasio of displeasure, then for any affection I bare to the town, before whose Fatherly aspect, when I was approached, my outward tears declaring my inward griefs: I fell prostrate on my knees and recognising my former follies, I craved meditation of forgiveness upon my speedy amendmet. At the which submission pardoning that which was past upon performace of my promise most like a loving Father received me again greatly joying my safe return. Nevertheless desirous not to remain with him above three or four days: I departed and made my repair to London, and in Tower street became Covenant with Master Stephen Heath a Vintner, till such time as my Father oppressed with infinite pains by means of this damnable sect did call me home cruelties and injuries done and wrought against the branch could not once stanch



their cruel minds, thirsting after innocent blood, without the life of my dear father, whose bitter pains diminishing his wonted strength by little and little caused him to yield unto the mercy of death, to the everlasting grief of all that loved him, but especially to me and other his poor children, left as sheep without a guide to the mercy of the Wolf. Alas what should I say? to render unto him his due praise, I want sufficiency, and to make long discourse of his mild and meek patience, wherein he continued unto the last hour of his gasping breath, I can not for tears and grief, wherefore against my will I am cut of from my purpose. But thus much you shall understand that no persuasions could prevail with him that he was bewitched, such was his strong belief in God, and yet diverse time sighingly complaining, would say: O Lord, shall a man dye and bee not sick? my heart is whole, and yet my inward pains consume me, and so meekly like a Lamb to the glory of God, taking and suffering his troubles, passed the straights of this mortal life, to lodge with Lazarus in Abrahams bosom.

Hhvve the Author after his fathers death abiding with his mother for her better comfort, framing him self to live in the world, was prevented by the said vvitches to his utter undoing to this day.
MY dear father by these helhoundes and Imps of the deuell, thus bereft me, and intiered in the ground (after whom we must all hie) I determined to the comfort of my mother, sorrowing the want of her wedded make, to abide with her, framing my self like a subject to live, and as it became an honest man to do, so long as the time of his pilgrimage gives him leave to abide, I went (with that little which God and my father had left me for my better maintenance) to buy sheep and other cattle, whereby by due foresight and diligent taking heed; I might make return of my principal with some advantage, but according to the proverb, he that reckoned before his host must reckon twice, and so it fell to my lot. For after I had




stored my self with the said Cattail more worth at the time of their sale, then the money I paid for them, they began now one then an other and in fine almost all to dye, and the rest living in such a case, lest that I was constrained to take half the money they cost me gaining by them as Dickens did by his Dishes who bying five for twopence sold six for a penny, my cattail thus being consumed, and many other attempts enterprised by me, turned topsy turuie, mine old accustomed and raging fits began to set foot within my mind I to imagine that Sedans whelps were now setting a brooch the vessel of their despite to seek my utter spoil and confusion. Wherefore I addressed my self to the woorshipfull Sir Henry Neuel Knight, who sufficiently before persuaded of my troubles, and greatly with my good Lady his bedfellow, (with whom I had often conference) pitying mine estate. I besought even in the bowels of our Lord Iesus Christ that either my Adversaries who hourly tormented me might be cut of: or I my self to receive the like punishment if good and sufficient proof were not on my side against them.

 How upon complaints made by the Author to Sir Henry Neuel they were commanded to be brought before him, and not being able to answer him in the Articles of the Christian faith, they were publikly set under the Pulpit,
Upon which complaint after Sir Henry Neuel had advised him self, moved with the pitiful aspect of my wildishe countenance, promise was made me that at a prefixed day he only for that purpose would come to Windesore, and upon due examination had, seek redress of my troubles. At which day appointed, I posted me to the lodging of the said Sir Henry Neuel being in the Castle, there to renew the remembrance of his promise, who knowing mine errand upon my first entrance into his Chamber commanded me forthwith to bring them before him, at which commandment, you may think I made no delay, but hasted me about my business, & brought



before him as many as I suspected, which were, Audrey the Mistress, Elizabeth Stile, Mother Dutton and Mother Nelson, saying, Sir I have executed your commandment and brought them into your presence, which if by good and sufficient trial, I can not prove to be Witches: let me receive the punishment due unto them, at which words quoth Sir Henry unto them, what say you to this? Then his Worship further examined them in the presence of Master Doctor Wickham Master Wullard a Prebend of the Castle, Master Morris, and Master Stafferton Gentlemen, how and after what sort they lived, whom they served and how they had employed their time, they answered, as every one would in his own case the best, saying, yt where they had been suspected to be Witches & woorkers of mischief against their neighbours, it was contrary and that the occasion put up against them was rather upon malice then otherwise. Then said I under your Woorships correction, if they be such good livers as they make them selves to be: I beseech you to examine them in the Articles of the Christian faith, and upon their answer judge of the rest. Then quoth Master Wickham, can you say the Lords prayer which he hath taught you? No forsooth quoth one, no forsooth quoth an other and likewise the rest, upon which replication: Master Wickham began with a most godly protestatio to persuade them not only to forsake their damnable ways before & at that time used, and diligently to learn the Lords prayer, the belief, and the ten Commandments, but also daily for their better instructions to have recourse unto the Temple of God, to hear his divine service, and for th'xecution there of (because none durst wade so far against them as I) I was appointed overseer, being charged that on the next Sunday following they should be brought to the Church, and publikly in the presence of all men to be set under the Pulpit during the time of Service.




 How the said VVitches were brought to the place appointed and how Audrey the Mistress and Mother Nelson with in short time after died, upon whose death the Author felt most grievous torments.
COnceiuig some good hope of future redress upon thexamination had before the said Gentlemen of worship if otherwise they were not converted from their folly: I hied me home to my Chamber, where locking the door to me I fell flat on the ground rendering thanks unto all mighty God for that it had pleased him of his infinite mercy to open the blind eyes of the Magistrates at the last to look upon such Offenders which before thorough their negligence, nusted up in all kind of wickedness, ceased not day nor night to oppress the Innocent, (my prayer ended) I went about my business until the day was come wherein I should doo my duty, at which day I armed my self in the Lord against the said Witches, whom gently entreating more to win their harts unto ye Lord, then for any fear I had of them: I conducted them to the Church and in the place appointed I set them down, (my self not standing far of the) where after by the Preacher they had received their lesson, and schooled for their lewd behaviour and idle life spent to no profit, but to invent wickedness and mischief, they departed home. Afterwards whether it were for grief of the correctio executed, or the inward gnawing of conscience, feeling themselves by the Preacher touched at the quick, (I cannot tel) but with in short space after, Audrey the Mistress and Mother Nelson dyed, after whose death the sisters left behind given over to their own lusts and suffered to wallow in their own wickedness, made their assembly in the pits in Master Dodges backside, a place where all their mischief was pretended, and there in generally agreed either to bring me unto my end, or living still to feel a life a hundred times more sharpe then a present death, if otherwise the sooner I sought not means to dislodge my self, and desirous not to use any delay in furthering their intents, about their accustomed



hours of meeting in the night: my bed, ordained for my quiet rest became the augmentor of my griefs, and in stead of sleep I was fed with continual watchings, caused through the extreme torturs and grievous pains sustained in the night. Thus having over passed many nights in pains, diverse and sundry times the aforesaid Cat or the devil him self in a Cats likeness: used to frequent and haunt my Chamber hurrying and buzzing about my bed, vexing and troubling me beyond all measure, in such strange and lamentable wise, that I was enforced with my weapon lying drawn vopon my bed to keep my self waking in prayers least being overcome with sleep: I should be strangled in my bed.





The Author being almost spent with grief, complains him the third time to Sir Henry Neuell, before whom he brought the said Elizabeth Stile bound with a cart rope on the market day.
COnsumed with these infinite pains both in body and purse eche night assailed with a new grief, loathing any longer to live, seeing that in four years past, no reformation might bee had for all my complaints. Leaving my careful bed, the witness of my grief and of my inward sorrow: I made me ready and girding my Skein about my middle with a good cudgel in my hand, I gate me to Farneham to the house of father Roseman, whom furiously pulling out of his house by head and shoulders I charged (not using any dalliance with me) to tell me my griefs. Who being aghast at my dealings, and fearing least that being not able to govern me in my fury, I would strike of his head: Said, O master you are bewitched, you are bewitched, wherefore look to your self, if not: in fine you will be destroyed, for you have many wicked women in Windsor, and such as doe much harm, and who practised the like on me once, because I did displease them. Then I bad him tell me what they were, who answered, that their names were Elizabeth Stile, Mother Dutton, and Mother Deuell, at which words leaving him (not altogether recovered of the fear he conceived by me) I went to the said Elizabeth Stiles house, charging her to go with me unto Sir Henry Neuelles, which squatting down upon her buttocks, she denied to doo. Then finding a Carte rope harde by, I bound it about her middle, and laid the rope on my shoulder, wherewith forcibly I pulled her out of her house, drawing her a long the streate, being on the market day (not one daring once to help me) but a little boy, which held the rope by the end) until I came unto the lodging of Sir Henry Neuell, unto whom in the presence of a company of Gentlemen at that time talking with him, I offered up my present, saying, behold



here rigth worshipful, I have brought you here a monster, which because of her feebled limbs, is not able to go, I have taken pains to draw. Then she began to curse, ban and swear, foaming at the mouth like a bore, to the great astonishement of all the beholders, which amassed with that horrible sight (more for fear I think then for any good will) suffered her to escape, with the which departure (as I could not choose being greatly grieved) seeing that for all my complaints made, no hope of redress was to bee looked for at the Magistrates hands: I thought now to use mine own force upon them. Wherefore daily frequenting my self to have once a day my recourse by their doors, I would now one, then an other, so Ribrost with my cudgel (carried always about me for the same purpose) that in the end getting the upper hand, I had them in such awe, that the Scholar having offended, feared not so much his Masters correction as they did my presence, as afterwards it appeared by Mother Dutton, who so soon as she had heard of my coming that way: would have run and locked her self into a Chest for fear.

Howe the Author having occasion to be abroad one night at the hour of their meeting, he saw the Deuell in a Carte sitting, and howe by the help of God he put him to flight, and of other strange accidents done by him.
MY courage now being augmented by the triumphant victory gotten over mine enemies, and feeling no more taste of my passed grieffes, my business so falling forth, it was my chance one night about xj. of the clock in the night to ride by the place where these Imps acustomed use was to meet, to my house.

And in my way as I was riding, my horse Leeyng




of a very good stomach, suddenly stopped flinging and lashing out behind, snorting and taking on out of all measure, neither proceeding further nor retorning back, wherewith all being little amassed because it was no strange thing unto me, I alighted and taking my sword drawn in the one hand, and my buckler in the other, casting mine eye aside to see if I could perceive any body stirring, I suddenly spied a most horrible sight and oughly fiend sitting in a poor mans cart, like one riding to fetch in his harvest, with a pair of eyes burning like the fiery flames, whose ugly shape when I beheld, falling on my knees in the midst of the dirt, I besought God to assist me with his strength against this fiend, and that through his mighty power I might get the victory. Then rising, I went towards the place where this good fellow was watching for his pray. At whom (my faith steadfastly set in the Lord) I let fly with my sword, saying, avoid Satan avoid, and in the name of God I charge thee to avoid, thou hast nought to do with me, wherefore go hunt after the Doe which hath caused thee here to sit. At which words: a great light appeared round about the carte where he sat, and therewithal an horrible sent of brimstone was dispersed abroad, but he was no more seen afterward, with the which sent Master Afton of the Scalding house coming that way the self same present time, thought presently to have died, had not help come in the mean time.
This done, I gate me to my horse, upon whose back when I was amounted: I passed to my house as quietly as might be without harm, where not forgetting the goodness of God towards them that put their trust in him, I spent an hour or two in prayer. The next day being come, no less desirous to be revenged of them then they were to molest me before: Hoping still to find a means to cut them off, and to weed them clean from the face of the earth, I practised many attempts, and not so many as often executed to the intent I might bee brought to some further answer, for the extirpating and pulling up the said wicked weeds by the roots. And because there was no Justice that would execute his office therein by the oath directed unto them. I determined to



prove what I could doo my self, wherefore I gat me a pound of brimstone, and melted the same and dipped therein as it melted a great dry linen cloth, and into a houile of straw of mother Duttons, I thrust it whereunto I put a great fire brand being of it self (the brimstone taken away) sufficient enough to have consumed a hundredth times as much, which burned unto ashes, yt straw not once perished. An other time likewise, one Richard Parker standing by, having bought a quarter of a pound of gun poulder, and as much of brimstone, I chose an arrow from out of a sheaf, and thereunto I bound the said poulder and brimstone with strings, making therein a little touchhole whereby to give fire thereunto (when I thought it good) and thrust the same into an other houile adjoining to her house, fully determined to bring her together with her house by fire to play the last act of her tragedy, unto the which, with a match set at the end of a long stick I gave fire, which arrow albeit, it consumed to ashes, yet nevertheless ye straw still remained without any sign of hurt which strange sight when I beheld, being a thing no less strange to be told, then harde to be believed: I sighing, said to my self. O Lord, what shall I doo unto this wicked imp, & to the rest of her confederates, whom neither fire or sword may devour, neither Gods thundering threats provoke to repentance. To suffer them longer to experiment life in their wickedness, and to the overthrow of their neighbours, my hart refuses. And still to contrive and spend my time about it: is to my hinderance. If I complain me of their detestable doings: the magistrates seam deaf, if I (as enemies to God and their Prince) molest or urge them: imprisonment laden with gyves falls out to my share. If I crave help of the inferior sort (my correction so affrays them) that albeit they would help, yet they dare not. Thus doo I see al hope of mas help taken from me, and all comfort bereft me: Wherefore I will henceforth cease and bridle my desires. And unto thee O Lord, which knowing the secretes of all men's hearts, can and wilt, when thou see the time, root out and pull up from thy good and chosen plants such wicked grafts. To thee (I say) will I remit my cause, and seek to lodge and settle



my self in some other soil where justice may be ministered, vice corrected, & wrongs redressed. And therewithal departed to my house, from whence within few days, after I had set my affairs in good order: I departed to seek my adventures, since which time of my departure, it hath pleases God at the last to strike these wicked and defestable livers with the rod of his correction. Who with the pot of their wickedness so long powered the water of God his vengeance upon them that at the length they were apprehended and committed to the common gaol there to remain until by due proof of their diabolical livings be tried, & after trial had, receive the Guerdon answerable their demerits, where being found guilty and convicted of the crime objected against them: they suffered at Abingdon the six and twenty day of February last past for the same, as by the brief and sum of their cofession here ensuing, thou may more at large perceive.

The cofession of Elizabeth Stile, alias Rockinham, a witch dvvelling in VVindsore in the County of Bark, declared in the gaol of Reading, in the said County in the xxi. year of the reign of our most dread sovereign Lady Elizabeth. Queen of England, France and Ireland &c.

6 Item this examinat further, says that father Rosimond and his daughter, mother Margaret, mother Dutto, and her self, were accustomed to make their meeting on the backside of Master Dodges, where they used to confer of such their enterprises as before they had determined of and practised.

9 Item one master Richard Galis Gent, (father of the author) who in times past, & yt thrice at ye least, as well for his wisdom as for his politic & good government, had been Mayor of windsor, was by their practise brought likewise to his end.

13. Item she also confesses that they altogether with one consent over spake on Humfrey Hesey and his wife, Richard Mils and Iohn Mattingley, so that they lay every one long time sick before they could recover again their health also and one Mastline a ?????????

14 Item she saith that on a time a Child (being a mans Son in Windesore) hurled a stone on her house wherewith being moved to anger she took his pot from him, threatened to be even with him, wherewithal the Child went home wards, and in the way meeting his Father he told him what had happened. To whom his Father said: ye hast done some unhappiness to her, come with me and I will speak with her, and as they went together towards her house, the Child suddenly began to cry out Oh my hand my hand, and his Father marveling what he ailed looking upon his hand and beholding it turned clean out of course and that otherwise then Nature had framed it: took it in his hand and assayed to have turned it right again, but he & an other man a neighbour of his (being with him at that present) could not doo it, the which was helped afterwards by Mother Dutton,

15. Item she saith that as working the death of th'afore named Lanckforde, Master Galis Lankfoords Maid and Suitcher the said Mother Dutton did make a picture of wax and did stick a hawthorn prick as it were against the hart of it that they died shortly after, and the said pictures they conveyed in a hole made for the nonce in the Chimney coruer, before the which they set two bricks & as the wax melted so the man consumed unto death by which means she saith they could kill any of what degree soever.

16. Item she also saith that the said Mother Dutton did give a picture but whether it were of man or woman she doth



not remember & the man that had it of her, she thinkeh to be dead, and also yt one Gorge Whiting servant to Matthew Pain of Cotton had a picture of her self for one Foster, for that that the same Gorge and Foster fell at words and the picture, was made in Mother Duttons house, and Mother Devil said to her bun, spare not to plague him, thrusting a hawthorn prick against the hart of it, so yt he lay at the point of death, a long time but in the end Mother Dutton recovered him again, using their extremity by kiling of a Cow of his.
17 Item the said Elizabeth saith that the said Mother Dutton and Mother Devil were the first Enticers of her to all those before said doings, and that she and every of them did oft times meet together at Master Dodges pits and soetime at the pound about eleven a clock at night, & that Mother Dutton and Mother Devil did allure her to doo and exercise yt craft which they them selves then and before used, and with them to sorsake God and all his woorks and to give her self to the Devil.

18 Item she saith that on a time she went to old Rosimans house and found him sitting at the root of an oak like an Ape and there talked with him long, and leaving him at her departure in the same shape, and at an other time she found him like an horse.

19. Item she saith that she went on a time to old Windesore to the bedmaker to beg milk which she could not have because the maid was a milking but at her return she said her Rat had provided both milk and cream.

20 Item she confesses that one Mother Audrey being one of the four that sat under the Pulpit before she wed inhabiting in the Alms house was the chief Mistress of them all but she is dead.

21 Item she saith that four or five of the ablest men in Windesor (if she had been so disposed) should not have brought her to the Gaol but that she came of her own accord, for by the way as she went with Iohn Browne to the Gaol who was her Guide thither, her Bun came to her in the like ness of a great black Cat and would have had her away, but

 To all which aforesaid Articles the said Elizabeth said she would affirm, and unto her death truly stand to.

This is not to be forgotten that the said Mother Stile albeit at the time of her apprehension and conduction to the Gaol she was of perfect limb and joint: yet nevertheless was she after the said confession made, so altered and changed, by the enchantments of her own Confederates: that she was ye most odiblest creature that ever man beheld, insomuch that she was brought upon a barrow to her arrainment before the Judges.

This is to be remembered also that amongst the Offenders before said, and that at the time of their execution, Mother Margaret being upon the ladder and ready to play the last act, of her life, and committing her self to the merecie of the law, by the which she was adjudged for her deserts to suffer death: began to say the Lords prayer in the which she continued till she came to these words and forgive vs our trespases &c. at which place making a stay crying out against one Sauoye Haruy of Windesor Ostler her accuser, which then was coming towards the place of the execution where they all suffered to see her end, saying art thou come to cast me away? and speak to the People then standing by, mark the end of him before this time tweluemoonth, and waxing ugly to the terror of the Beholders she impatiently ended her life.

    Finis.


The Conclusion to the Reader.
THhus hast thou heard here most loving Reader how much the foolish pity and slackness of the Magistrates of Windesore in executing their office, hath given occasion to these wicked Imps



the Daughters of the Devil, to persist in their folly, thou hast heard also remembered unto thee what drifts of devilish devises since the first time of mother Duttons apprehension and brought by me before Master Richard Redforth then Mayor of Windesore, hath by them been practised to the great hurt of the Inhabitants, their neighbours, and to thy great admiration, which if at that present had been as thorowely sifted out as it was but wincked at, and as to late (I may say) it hath been by some, (since those persons in the before confession mentioned and by their enchantments brought to their ends) not only had enjoyed their lives until this day: but I also a most loving Father and they them selves an assured and steadfast rock in the time of their need, where now by their sufferance wee be deprived of both. But sith to call things long time past in oblivion to remembrance again, will but increase my grief and renew my sorrow: I therefore will with the vale of silence cover that which my hart desired to express. Only I beseech the heavenly Father who is the giver of all goodness that this ensample past and now to all men most apparent, may be so printed and rooted in the harts of all Magistrates appointed for the execution of true and upright Justice to the maintenaune of the good and pulling down of the wicked, that from hence forth not only all poor men's causes may be pitied, their complaints accepted, and their wrongs redressed: but also that by their careful industry and diligence employed, all Sorcerers, Witches and Charmerers may utterly be weeded out from the face of the earth to the commodity of a common wealth and to the honour & glory of God, to whom be all praise, laud, dominion and power for ever and ever Amen.
