To the Reader.
THE MANIFOLD untruths which is spread abroad, concerning the detestable actions and apprehension of those Witches whereof this History following truly entreats, hath caused me to publish the same in print: and the rather for that sundry written Copies are lately dispersed thereof, containing, that the said witches were first discovered, by means of a poor Peddler travailing to the town of Trenent, and that by a wonderful manner he was in a moment conveyed at midnight, from Scotland to Bordeaux in France (being places of no small distance between) into a Merchants Seller there, & after, being sent from Bordeaux into Scotland by certain Scottish Merchants to the Kings Majesty, that he discovered those Witches and was the cause of their apprehension: with a number of matters miralous

and incredible: All which in truth are most false. Nevertheless to satisfy a number of honest minds, who are desirous to be informed of the verity and truth of their confessions, which for certainty is more stranger then the common report runs, and yet with more truth I have undertaken to publish this short Treatise, which declares the the true discourse of all that hath happened, & as well what was pretended by those wicked and detestable Witches against the Kings Majesty, as also by what means they wrought the same.
All which examinations (gentle Reader) I have here truly published, as they were taken and uttered in the presence of the Kings Majesty, praying thee to accept it for verity, the same being so true as cannot be reproved.
A true discourse, Of the apprehension of sundry Witches lately taken in Scotland: whereof some are executed, and some are yet imprisoned.

With a particular recital of their examinations, taken in the presence of the Kings Majesty.
GOd by his omnipotent power, hath at al times and daily doth take such care, and is so vigillant, for the weal and preservation of his own, that thereby he disappointed the wicked practises and evil intents of all such as by any means whatsoever, seek indirectly to conspire any thing contrary to his holy will: yea and by the same power, he hath lately overthrown and hindered the intentions and wicked dealings of a great number of ungodly creatures, no better then Devils: who suffering themselves to be allured and enticed by the Devil whom they served, and to whom they were privately sworn: entered into ye detestable Art of witchcraft,

which they studied and practised so long time, that in the end they had seduced by their sorcery a number of other to be as bad as themselves: dwelling in the bounds of Lowthian, which is a principal shire or part of Scotland, where the Kings Majesty uses to make his chiefest residence or abode: and to the end that their detestable wickedness which they privily had pretended against the Kings Majesty, the Commonwealth of that Country, with the Nobility and subjects of the same, should come to light: God of his unspeakable goodness did reveal and lay it open in very strange sort, thereby to make known unto the world, that their actions were contrary to the law of God, and the natural affection which we ought generally to bear one to another: the manner of the revealing whereof was as follows.
Within the town of Trenent in the Kingdom of Scotland, there dwells one Dauid Seaton, who being deputy Bailiff in the said Town, had a maid servant called Geillis Duncan, who used secretly to be absent and to lye forth of her Masters house every other night: this Geillis Duncan took in hand to help all such as were troubled or grieved with any kind of sickness or infirmity: and in short space did perform many matters most miraculous, which things forasmuch as she began to doe them upon a sudden, having never done the like



before, made her Master and others to be in great admiration, and wondered thereat: by means whereof the said Dauid Seaton had his maid in some great suspicion, that she did not those things by natural and lawful ways, but rather supposed it to be done by some extraordinary and unlawful means.
Whereupon, her Master began to grow very inquisitive, and examined her which way and by what means she were able to perform matters of so great importance: whereat she gave him no answer, nevertheless, her Master to the intent that he might the better try and find out the truth of the same, did with the help of others, torment her with the torture of the Pilliwinckes upon her fingers, which is a grievous torture, and binding or wrenching her head with a corde or rope, which is a most cruel torment also, yet would she not confess any thing, whereupon they suspecting that she had been marked by the Devil (as commonly witches are) made diligent search about her, and found the enemies mark to be in her fore crag or fore-part of her throat: which being found, she confessed that all her doings was done by the wicked allurements and enticements of the Devil, and that she did them by witchcraft.

After this her confession, she was committed to prison, wheee she continued for a season,




where immediately she accused these persons following to be notorious witches, and caused them forthwith to be apprehended one after an  other, vidz. Agnis Simpson the eldest Witch of them al, dwelling in Haddington, Agnes Tompson of Edenbrough, Doctor Feign, alias Iohn Cunningham, master of the School at Saltpans


in Lowthian, of whose life and strange acts, you shall hear more largely in the end of this discourse: these were by the said Geillis Duncan accused, as also George Motts wife dwelling in Saltpans, Robert Griersonn skipper, and Iennit Bandilandis, with the Porters wife of Seaton, the Smith at the brigge Hallis with innumerable others in that parts, and dwelling in those bounds aforesaid: of whom some are already executed, the rest remain in prison, to receive the doom of Judgment at the Kings majesties will and pleasure.
The said Geillis Duncan also caused Ewphame Meealrean to be apprehended, who conspired and performed the death of her Godfather, and who used her art upon a gentleman being one of the Lords and Justices of the Session, for bearing good will to her Daughter: she also caused to be apprehended one Barbara Nipper, for bewitching to death Archibalde, last Earl of Angus, who languished to death by withcraft and yet the same was not suspected, but that he died of so strange a disease, as the Physician knew not how to cure or remedy the same: but of all other the said witches, these two last before recited, were reputed for as civil honest women as any that dwelled within the City of Edenbrough, before they were apprehended. Many other besides were taken dwelling in




Lies, who are detained in prison, until his Majesties further will and pleasure be known of whose wicked doings you shall particularly hear, which was as follows.
This aforesaid Agnis Simpson which was the elder Witch, was taken and brought to Haliriud house before the Kings Majesty and sundry other of the nobility of Scotland, where she was straightly examined, but all the persuasions which the Kings majesty used to her with ye rest of his counsel, might not provoke or induce her to confess any thing, but stood stiffly in the beniall of all that was laid to her charge: whereupon they caused her to be conveyed away to prison, there to receive such torture as hath been lately provided for witches in that country: and forasmuch as by due examination of witchcraft and witches in Scotland, it hath lately been found that the Devil doth generally mark them with a privy mark, by reason the Witches have confessed themselves, that the Devil doth lick them with his tongue in some privy part of their body, before he doth receive them to be his servants, which mark commonly is given them under the hair in some part of their body, whereby it may not easily be found out or seen, although they be searched: and generally so long as the mark is not seen to those which search them, so long the parties that hath the



mark will never confess any thing. Therefore by special commandment this Agnis Simpson had all her hair shaven of, in each part of her body, and her head thrawen with a rope according to the custom of that Country, being a pain most grievous, which she continued almost an hour, during which time she would not confess any thing until the Devils mark was found upon her privities, then she immediately confessed whatsoever was demanded of her, and iustifying those persons aforesaid to be notorious witches.
Item, the said Agnis Tompson was after brought again before the Kings Majesty and his Counsel, and being examined of the meetings and detestable dealings of those witches, she confessed that upon the night of Allhollon Even last, she was accompanied as well with the persons aforesaid, as also with a great many other witches, to the number of two hundredth: and that all they together went by Sea each one in a Riddle or Ciue, and went in the same very substantially with Flagons of wine making merry and drinking by the way in the same Riddles or Ciues, to the kirk of North Barrick in Lowthian, and that after they had landed, took hands on the land and danced this reill or short dance, singing all with one voice.




Commer go ye before, commer go ye,
Gif ye will not go before, commer let me.
At which time she confessed, that this Geilles Duncan did go before them playing this reill ordaunce upon a small Trump, called a Iewes Trump, until they entered into the Kirk of north Barrick.

These confessions made the King in a woderful admiration, and sent for ye said Geillis Dun¦cane, who upon the like Trump did play the said dance before the Kings Majesty, who in respect of the strangeness of these matters, took great delight to bee present at their examinations.

Item, the said Agnis Tompson confessed that the Devil being then at North Barrick Kirk attending their coming in the habit or likeness of a man, and seeing that they tarried ouer-long, he at their coming enjoined them all to a penance, which was, that they should kiss his Buttocks, in sign of duty to him: which being put over the Pulpit bar, every one did as he had enjoined them: and having made his ungodly exhortations, wherein he did greatly inveigh against the King of Scotlond, he received their oaths for their good and true service towards him, and departed: which done, they returned to Sea, and so home again.

At which time the witches demanded of the Devil why he did bear such hatred to the King, who answered, by reason the King is the greatest enemy he hath in the world: all which their confessions and depositions are still extant upon record.
Item, the said Agnis Simpson confessed before the Kings Majesty sundry things which were so miraculous and strange, as that his Majesty said they were all extreme liars, whereat she answered, she would not wish his Majesty to suppose her words to be false, but rather to believe them, in that she would discover such matter unto him as his majesty should not any way doubt off.

And thereupon taking his Majesty a little aside, she declared unto him the very words which passed between the Kings Majesty and his Queen at Upslo in Norway the first night of their marriage, with their answer each to other: whereat the Kings Majesty wondered greatly, and swore by the living God, that he believed that all the Devils in hell could not have discovered the same: acknowledging her words to be most true, and therefore gave the more credit to the rest which is before declared.

Touching this Agnis Tompson, she is the only woman, who by the Devils persuasion should have intended and put in execution the

Kings Majesties death in this manner.
She confessed that she took a black Toad, and did hang the same up by the heals, three days, and collected and gathered the venom as it dropped and fell from it in an Oyster shell, and kept the same venom close covered, until she should obtain any part or piece of foul linen cloth, that had appertained to the Kings Majesty, and shirt, handkercher, napkin or any other thing which she practised to obtain by means of one Iohn Kers, who being attendant in his Majesties Chamber, desired him for old acquaintance between them, to help her to one or a piece of such a cloth as is aforesaid, which thing the said Iohn Kers denied to help her too, saying he could not help her too it.

And the said Agnis Tompson by her depositions since her apprehension saith, that if she had obtained any one piece of lines cloth which the King had worn and fouled, she had bewitched him to death, and put him to such extraordinary pains, as if he had been lying upon sharp thorns and ends of Needles.

Moreover she confessed that at the time when his Majesty was in Denmark, she being accompanied with the parties before specially named, took a Cat and christened it, and afterword bound to each part of that Cat, the chiefest parts of a dead man, and several joins of

his bodies, and that in the night following the said Cat was conveyed into the midst of the sea by all these witches sailing in their riddles or Ciues as is aforesaid, and so left the said Cat right before the Town of Lies in Scotland: this done, there did arise such a tempest in the Sea, as a greater hath not been seen: which tempest was the cause of the perishing of a Boat or vessel coming over from the town of Brunt Island to the town of Lies, wherein was sundry Jewels and rich gifts, which should have been presented to the now Queen of Scotland, at her Majesties coming to Lies.
Again it is confessed, that the said christened Cat was the cause that the Kings Majesties Ship at his coming forth of Denmark, had a contrary wind to the rest of his Ships, then being in his company, which thing was most strange and true, as the Kings Majesty acknowledges, for when the rest of the Ships had a fair and good wind, then was the wind contrary and altogether against his Majesty: and further the said witch declared, that his Majesty had never come safely from the Sea, if his faith had not prevailed above their intentions.

Moreover the said Witches being demanded

how the Devil would use them when he was in their company, they confessed that when the Devil did receive them for his servants, and that they had vowed themselves unto him, then he would Carnally use them, albeit to their little pleasure, in respect of his cold nature: and would doo the like at sundry other times.
As touching the aforesaid Doctor Feign, alias Iohn Cunningham, the examination of his acts since his apprehension, declares the great subtlety of the devil, and therefore makes things to appear the more miraculous: for being apprehended by the accusation of the said Geillis Duncan aforesaid, who confessed he was their Register, and that there was not one man suffered to come to the Devils readinges but only he: the said Doctor was taken and imprisoned, and used with the accustomed pain, provided for those offences, inflicted upon the rest as is aforesaid.

First by thrawing of his head with a rope, whereat he would confess nothing.

Secondly, he was persuaded by fair means to confess his follies, but that would prevail as little.

Lastly he was put to the most severe and cruel pain in the world, called the boots, who after



he had received three strokes, being enquired if he would confess his damnable acts and wicked life, his tongue would not serve him to speak, in respect whereof the rest of the witches willed to search his tongue, under which was found two pins thrust up into the head, whereupon the UUitches did lay, Now is the Charm stinted, and showed that those charmed Pins were the cause he could not confess any thing: then was he immediately released of the boots, brought before the King, his confession was taken, and his own hand willingly set ther-vnto, which contained as follows.
First, that at the general meetings of those witches, he was always preasent: that he was Clarke to all those that were in subjection to the Devils service, bearing the name of witches, that always he did take their oaths for their true service to the Devil, and that he wrote for them such matters as the Devil still pleased to command him.

Item, he confessed that by his witchcraft he did be witch a Gentleman dwelling near to the Saltpans, where the said Doctor kept School, only for being enamoured of a Gentlewoman whom he loved himself: by means of which




his Sorcery, witchcraft and devilish practises, he caused the said Gentleman that once in xxiiij. hours he fell into a lunacy and madness, and so  continued one whole hour together, and for the verity of the same, he caused the Gentleman to be brought before the Kings Majesty, which was upon the xxiiij. day of December last, and


in his Majesties Chamber, suddenly he gave a great scritch and fell into a madness, sometime bending himself, and sometime capering so directly up, that his head did touch the feeling of the Chamber, to the great admiration of his Majesty and others then present: so that all the Gentlemen in the Chamber were not able to hold him, until they called in more help, who together bound him hand and foot: and suffering the said gentleman to lye still until his fury were past, he within an hour came again to himself, when being demanded of the Kings Majesty what he saw or did all that while, answered that he had been in a sound sleep.
Item the said Doctor did also confess that he had used means sundry times to obtain his purpose and wicked intent of the same Gentlewoman, and seeing himself disappointed of his intention, he determined by all ways he might to obtain the same, trusting by conjuring, witchcraft and Sorcery to obtain it in this manner.

It happened this gentlewoman being unmarried, had a brother who went to school with the said Doctor, and calling his Scholar to him, demanded if he did lye with his sister, who answered he did, by means whereof he thought to obtain his purpose, and therefore secretly promised to teach him without stripes, so he would obtain for him three hairs of his sisters privities.




at such time as he should spy best occasion for it: which the youth promised faithfully to perform, and vowed speedily to put it in practise, taking a piece of conjured paper of his master to lap them in when he had gotten them: and there upon the boy practised nightly to obtain his masters purpose, especially when his sister was a sleep.
But God who knows the secrets of all harts, and reveals all wicked and ungodly practises, would not suffer the intents of this devilish Doctor to come to that purpose which he supposed it would, and therefore to declare that he was heavily offended with his wicked intent, did so work by the Gentlewoman's own means, that in the end the same was discovered and brought to light: for she being one night a sleep, and her brother in bed with her, suddenly cried out to her mother, declaring that her Brother would not suffer her to sleep, whereupon her mother having a quick capacity, did vehemently suspect Doctor Fians intention, by reason she was a witch of her self, and therefore presently arose, and was very inquisitive of the boy to understand his intent, and the better to know ye same, did beat him with sundry stripes, whereby he discovered the truth unto her.





The Mother therefore being well practised in witchcraft, did think it most convenient to meet with the Doctor in his own Art, and thereupon took the paper from the boy, wherein he should have put the same hairs, and went to a young Heifer which never had borne Calfe nor gone to the Bull, and with a pair of shears, clipped off three hairs from the vdder of the Cow, and wrapped them in the same paper, which she again delivered to the boy, then willing him to give the same to his said Master, which he immediately did.
The Schoolmaster so soon as he had received them, thinking them indeed to bee the Maids hairs, went straight and wrought his art upon them: But the Doctor had no sooner done his intent to them, but presently the Heifer or Cow whose hairs they were indeed, came unto the door of the Church wherein the Schoolmaster was, into the which the Heifer went, and made towards the Schoolmaster, leaping and dancing upon him, and following him forth of the church and to what place so ever he went, to the great admiration of all towns men of Saltpans, and many other who did behold the same.

The report whereof made all men imagine




that he did work it by the Devil, without whom it could never have been so sufficiently effected: and thereupon, the name of the said Doctor Feign (who was but a very young man) began to grow so common among the people of Scotland, that he was secretly nominated for a notable Cuniurer. 


All which although in the beginning he denied, and would not confess, yet having felt the pain of the boots (and the charm stinted, as aforesaid) he confessed all the aforesaid to be most true, without producing any witnesses to justify the same, & thereupon before the kings majesty he subscribed the said confessions with his own hand, which for truth remains upon record in Scotland.
After that the depositions and examinations of the said doctor Feign Alias Cuningham was taken, as already is declared, with his own hand willingly set thereunto, he was by the master of the prison committed to ward, and appointed to a chamber by himself, where forsaking his wicked ways, acknowledging his most ungodly life, showing that he had too much followed the allurements and enticements of satan, and fondly practised his conclusions by conjuring, witchcraft, enchantment, sorcery, and such like, he renounced the devil and all his wicked works, vowed to lead the life of a Christian, and seemed newly converted towards God.

The morrow after upon conference had with him, he granted that the devil had appeared unto him in the night before, appareled all in black, with a white wand in his hand, and that the devil demanded of him if he would continue his faithful service, according to his first oath and promise made to that effect. Whom (as he then




said) he utterly renounced to his face, and said unto him in this manner, Avoid Satan, avoid, for I have listened too much unto thee, and by the same thou hast undone me, in respect whereof I utterly forsake thee. To whom the devil answered, That once ere thou die thou shalt bee mine. And with that (as he said) the devil brake the white wand, and immediately vanished forth of his sight.
Thus all the day this Doctor Feign continued very solitary, and seemed to have care of his own soul, and would call upon God, showing himself penitent for his wicked life, nevertheless the same night he found such means, that he stole the key of the prison door and chamber in the which he was, which in the night he opened and fled away to the Salt pans, where he was always resident, and first apprehended. Of whose sudden departure when the Kings majesty had intelligence, he presently commanded diligent inquiry to bee made for his apprehension, and for the better effecting thereof, he sent public proclamations into all parts of his land to the same effect. By means of whose hot and harde pursuit, he was again taken and brought to prison, and then being called before the kings highness, he was reexamined as well touching his departure, as also touching all that had before happened.
But this Doctor, notwithstanding that his own confession appears remaining in record under his own hand writing, and the same thereunto fixed in the presence of the Kings majesty and sundry of his Council, yet did he utterly deny the same.
Whereupon the kings majesty perceiving his stubborn wilfulness, conceived and imagined that in the time of his absence he had entered into new conference and league with the devil his master, and that he had been again newly marked, for the which he was narrowly searched, but it could not in any wise bee found, yet for more trial of him to make him confess, he was commanded to have a most strannge torment which was done in this manner following.

His nails upon all his fingers were riuen and pulled off with an instrument called in Scottish a Turks, which in England wee call a pair of pincers, and under every nail there was thrust in two needles over even up to the heads. At all which torments notwithstanding the Doctor never shronke any whit, neither would he then confess it the sooner for all the tortures inflicted upon him.

Then was he with all convenient speed, by commandment, conveyed again to the torment




of the boots, wherein he continued a long time, and did abide so many blows in them, that his leg•es were crushed and beaten together as small as might bee, and the bones and flesh so bruised, that the blood and marrow spouted forth in great abundance, whereby they were made vnseruiceable for ever. And notwithstanding al these grievous pains and cruel torments he would not confess any thing, so deeply had the devil entered into his heart, that he utterly denied all that which he had before avouched, and wou•de say nothing thereunto but this, that what he had done and said before, was only done and said for fear of pains which he had endured.
Upon great consideration therefore taken by the Kings majesty and his Council, as well for the due execution of justice upon such detestable malefactors, as also for example sake, to remain a terror to all others hereafter, that shall attempt to deal in the like wicked and ungodly actions, as witchcraft, sorcery, cuniuration, & such like, the said Doctor Feign was soon after arraigned, condemned, and adjudged by the law to die, and then to bee burned according to the law of that land, provided in that behalf. Whereupon he was put into a carte, and being first strangled, he was immediately put into a great fire, being ready provided for that purpose, and there



burned in the Castle hill of Edenbrough on asaterdaie in the end of January last past. 1591.
The rest of the witches which are not yet executed, remain in prison till farther trail, and knowledge of his majesties pleasure.

This strange discourse before recited, may perhaps give some occasion of doubt to such as shall happen to read the same, and thereby conjecture that the Kings majesty would not hazard himself in the presence of such notorious witches, least thereby might have ensued great danger to his person and the general state of the land, which thing in truth might well have been feared. But to answer generally to such, let this suffice: that first it is well known that the King is the child & servant of God, and they but servants to the devil, he is the Lords anointed, and they but vessels of Gods wrath: he is a true Christian, and trusts in God, they worse than Infidels, for they only trust in the devil, who daily serve them, till he have brought them to utter destruction. But hereby it seems that his Highness carried a magnanimous and undaunted mind, not feared with their enchantments, but resolute in this, that so long as God is with him, he fears not who is against him. And truly the whole scope of this treatise doth so plainly lay open the wonderful providence of the Almighty, that if he had not been defended by his omnipotence and power, his Highness had never returned alive in his voyage frō Denmark, so that there is no doubt but God would as well defend him on the land as on the sea, where they pretended their damnable practise.
