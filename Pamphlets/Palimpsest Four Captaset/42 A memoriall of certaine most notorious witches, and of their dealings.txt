A memorial of certain most notorious witches, and of their dealings
THere dwelled not so long since, but shat of some it may be remembered. In Barking in Essex seven miles distraunt from London a Witch named mother white-coate alias mother Aruold alias mother Glassenbury who committed many execrable facts, as may appear.

There was dwelling in Barking one Thomas Clark a fisher who having angered this witch, went forth in mackerel

time to catch flounders, and he and two boys sailing down almost as far as Lee where they cast out his nets, in the same place was such an neddy that he could by no means work, neither his nets come in order, as they should do, but upon a sudden this Clarke cried out and said that he saw mother Arnold the witch walking in the water, and withal cried the spirit entered into him and moved him to kill him self so that he took a hatchet, a hook and a knife and threw them ouerbourd and after tied he himself about the middle with a rope and so fell mad, so that the boys cried unto other fishermen, who seeking to help him, there was a whirlepoole that had almost cast them away so that none durst come near them, atlength a boat of Green which perceiving the whirl poole threw a rope unto them and so plucked him into his boat and so brought him home to Barking where he remained mad, and lying still bound cried out of mother Arnold, and in the end dyed thus tormented.
The said mother Arnold going in precession with other her neighbours in gangweek and William Daulbie seeing her very lively came unawares behind her and struck up her heals giving her a fall, and after thrust him self into the press of the people to the intent she might not know who did it, but she arising came immediately to him taking him by the hand thanked him for her fall, and said she would be even with him.

They went to one Malles house a mile and a half from Barking where she complained of the young man and after some victuals given her by the good wise went homeward again.

Malles wise and Daulbie going to Barking together a good pace but could set no eye of her, till they came by Barking, where she sat a praying under a tree, and so passed by her, and so went home, where being not a quarter of an hour, but Daulbie was so miserably vexed, that he sought to kill himself, thrust his head into the swilling tub full of swines meat, where he had smothered him self if help had not prevented it.

Then would he have run into an hot oven to the burning fire brands with his teeth that he burned his mouth and lips very sore: when night came his friends had him to bed, but his vexation growing worse and worse and he feeling his bowels burn within him (as a pot seething on the fire) could not endure

the bed but lay for the most part all the night out of a window which he so byted with his teeth that it may be perceived still, so long as the window endures, and in these miserable cases continued. At last helped by an other witch, was at the Asses bound to appear at Burnt wood where he gave evidence against mother Arnold in the hearing ofher own daughter, who after came to him and said you have given shrode evidence against my mother but you will be little better for it. And the next night following, rising to make water was stricken in the neck that he fell sick and was fine to be brought from Burnt wood to Rainford in a Cart, and so from thence home, being piteously vexed till he gave up the ghost.
WHen Master Clement Sisley Esquire had examined this witch and told her she should go to prsson the wiech desired that she might not go to prison, for the spirit would be revenged as it happened when he took paper in his hand to make his warrant suddenly both his feet were taken from him by reason whereof, he fell on a plain pavement of free stone in his own house at Tastburyhall and struck out the huckle bone of his thigh out of the joint, so that for three weeks space he could not go, nor stand along time after her erecution but used stiles for necessities sake.

But before he committed her to the Iaiole, he caused her to be searched by honest wives who between her kerchief and her hat found wrapped in a linen cloth swines dung, the herb chervell dill, red fenell and saint Iohns woort, the right hand or forefoote of a Moulewarp, which upon the opening so stanck that no person could abide it.

After the finding of this she kneeled down upon her knees, desiring them if she might not have the whole, yet to let her have some part thereof, but the same by the commandment of the Justice was burned.

IF I should write at full the manifold mischiefs of this most detestable practicioner, they would fill a great volume, as how she lamed Newman of Stratford a tanner, how she stole


an handchercher from his wife and after five days keeping it sent it back again by one of her neighbours who delivering it, fair, and white, to Newmans maid, presently there fell three drops of blood upon it one after another, and the maid amazed giving it to her mistress it became all over red as blood most wonderful.
Also how she vexed one Harison being a Dutch man meeting him at Mile-end and stroke him so lame that he was fine to hire a horse, to carry him home, and bewitched him dumb, that he could not speak: and made his horse to shake, and dance, for the space of one whole year.

Also how she threatened George Male at the Greyhound at Barking that for so much as he thrust her and her daughter out of his doors and would give them nothing, this witch threatened that she would set a Bee in his tail the next time. Yea and that a stinger said the daughter. So not long after he determining to ride, put on a new pair of hose with a double rug in them prized forty shillings, the first day of his riding he was so tickled in the buttock, that he scratched through all, both hose and linings and such a hole in his slesh, that it was not whole a m???neth after.

Many other mischiefs might be here numbered, but I mean not to stand long upon these detestable actions only this to be noted, that being often examined, when she was to answer suddenly there rose in her throat a swelling as big as a mans fist, black as pitch, and then she seemed to have the hitchcough, as though she would speak but could not, and in this case the examiners would strike her on the breast but she required them not to doe so: And when she was executed such a stinking vapour issued forth of her mouth that the beholders were scantly able to endure it. All which is most wonderful.

I might here noate the cruel devises of mother Bumby the witch of Rochester: the tyranny of the witches of VVarboys. and many other, but for breuities sake I omit the??, putting them in memory of one the most strange of all other, committed in March 1592. near Harrow on the bill.

One Master Edling having a barn at the towns end, his servant Richard Bust going thither with a mastiff dog after

him, suddenly espied an hair to fiart before him and set his dog at her, but the mastiff refusing the chase ran round about the fellow whining pittiefully, but the fellow left not till he saw the hare take in at one mother Atkins house, known to be a notorious witch.
The fellow perceiving this, blessed him self and bad avaunt witch, which turned to his woe for a month after or there about he going to his masters barn again met this mother Atkins and bad her good morrow, but the witch would not answer.

The next day he went to the barn again and carried with him his dinner and going to his victuals about noon he saw a monstrous black cat, among the straw shaking it, whereat Richard rising up from whence he sat, heard avoid commanding him to come away.

Come away thought he whether shall I come? the voice said again come away and leave thy victuals behind thee and thy knife also: the fellow amazed went with his victuals in his hand to the barn door and there was hoisted up suddenly into the ayre and carried over many fields by the way espying his masters plough plowing but not able to call to them from thence he was hoistedouer to Harrow over that side of the hill, whereon there is a great pond of water through which was drawn most piteously that there he lost his hat and then was violently rapt up the hill, and over the tops of the trees by Harrow church but being haled further, he was taken into a place which was al fire wherein was such lamentable crying and howling as all the damned goules had been there, such stuicks, such darkness, such noise and such heat that it made him so thirsty that he knew not what to doe: where upon he having but one penny in his purse remembered it, and looked round about for an alehouse where he might spend it. But perceiving no such matters but hearing variety of voices supposing some had spoken unto him he replied saying, here is no work for me to doe, it was reanswered again, coast away with him with this proviso, that thou bee seceret when then comes home: whereupon Richard said my master will ache me where I have been and with that his tongue was doubled in his mouth that he could not speak, his legs burned, his arms and hands scorched, his coat pinched of his back and throne into the fire and immediately was again coasted over hedges and ditches saved in mire and dirt scratched with thorns and briars and finally to beddawbed, singed and diffigued that it was most lamentable to behold him.
Thus being brought again to his wouted place or dwelling he went to a ditch to drink and after to a friend of his being now absent four days & as then able to speak, his master not knowing him at the first, but afterwards with much a doe his tongue being unfolded he told all the story as you have heard & would not be quieted till he had drawn blood of mother Atkins since which time he is amended.

Th??s have you heard the mostnotorious fact that ever witchcraft hatched, omitting many other, from all which our good God deliver vs. Amen.
