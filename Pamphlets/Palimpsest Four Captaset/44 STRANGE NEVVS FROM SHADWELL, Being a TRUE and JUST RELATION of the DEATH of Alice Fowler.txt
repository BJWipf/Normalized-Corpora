STRANGE NEWS FROM SHADWELL, Being a TRUE and JUST RELATION of the DEATH of Alice Fowler,

Who had for many years been accounted a Witch; together with the Manner how she was found Dead with both her great Toes Tied together, and laid out on the Floor having a Blanket flung over her. She being left locked up alone by her Nurse, with a discovery of what Marks or Teats were found about her, when she was searched by the Neighbours.


IN King-street near Whapping, the one part of it being in the Parish of St. Paul Shadwel, and the other in the Parish of Whapping; lately lived a VViddow Woman named Alice Fowler, she was about the Age of Fourscore Years, and had always been a malicious ill-natured Woman and for many years had been reputed a Witch; she was always observed to be muttering and grumbling to her self, and was continually holding a Discourse as it were within her self, and some that knew her would often say that at those times she conversed with Familiars or Spirits; she was always
poor, as it is observable that those kind of People are: Her way of living being to sell Bisquets to Bawdy houses, where she generally got Drunk, and being a very Debauched and Lewd Woman, and despised and slighted by the Neighbourhood for this her lewd and base course of Life. By such small Shifts, together with the Assistanae of the Charity of the Trinity House into which by reason she was Ancient and a Seamans Widow she had of late years gotten; she with much ado lived a necessitous and miserable life, being continually in want, and at variance with all that knew her.
Above twenty years since she nursed a Girl who did always report that she was a Witch, and after she was at a women's Estate was still fearful and apprehensive of her, until the time of her Death. It is believed the Child had been affrighted by some of her Tricks when she was Young, which made her in the greatest Dread and Terror imaginable of her ever after.

About sixteen Years since, Walter Fowler her Son was Transported to Barbados, who always used to declare that his Mother was a Witch, that she had bewitched him and several others, and would relate several strange Exploits of her doing, and saying often to others that she was there in the Room and tempted him to do such and such Mischiefs, and would aver that he saw her present, when no one else in the place could see anything; this mind he continued in, always accusing her of bewitching him, until about nine Years since that he was hanged in the Island of Barbados, for Murdering his Wife and king open a House.

About six weeks since, she having lain sick a considerable time in King-street aforesaid, where she had a mean Room Furnished, and having a poor Neighbour to look after and nurse her; she sent her out of an Errand to fetch her something she had occasion for, and the woman going out of Doors, locked the Door and took the Key with her, leaving no body there save the aforesaid Alice sick in her Bed, and coming back again, found the said Alice stripped, dead and cold as Clay laying on the Floor on her Back, and having her two great Toes tied together, and a Blanket flung over her; the poor woman being very much surprised at this, called in the Neighbours who were all in great astonishment when they saw the Corps lying, and had had an account how it was left, and the rather in that there was so great a stink when they stirred the Corps that they could hardly endure the Room.
Several of the Neighbours were so curious to search the Corps, and do all of them affirm that they found in the private parts of the Corps five Teats; to wit, four small ones and one very big, and that they were all of them as black as a Coal.

This considered, together with her ill report that she had when alive, made all the neighbours refuse to accompany the Corps to the Earth, so that the next day she was put into the Church Coffin, and by the Bearers without any more company buried in the Church-Yard of St. Paul Shadwell; so that as in her Life she was little beloved, at her Funeral she was as much slighted and scorned by every body, no one offering to accompany her Corps, as is before rehearsed.

If any one is so curious to make a farther enquiry into this Matter, it is so known a Truth to the inhabitants of King-street aforesaid, that there is not one in the place but can affirm and justify the whole Relation; and the Matter is so fresh, that it is impossible it should be yet forgotten, it being not above six Weeks since the Woman died, as I am informed by a credible Person that went to enquire of the Business amongst the neighbours, and was one that well knew the said Alice Fowler in her Life time, and from whom I had this Relation; which in regard of the strangeness, I thought fit to Publish.
