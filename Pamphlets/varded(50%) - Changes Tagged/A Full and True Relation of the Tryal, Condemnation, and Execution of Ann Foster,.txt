A Full and True Relation of the <normalised orig="Tryal" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, Condemnation, and Execution of Ann Foster, (who was <normalised orig="arrained" auto="true">arraigned</normalised> for a Witch) on Saturday, the 22th of this Instant August, at the place of Execution at Northampton.

Notwithstanding that many have taken very great pains to confute, by reason of the opinion so long held in the world, that there have been and are Witches, arguing against the express text of Scripture, Thou shat not suffer a Witch to live; and falsely finding out <normalised orig="Sophismes" auto="true">Sophisms</normalised> to make a Witch of Endor, I know not what kind of Cunning Woman, taught only to play tricks by the Idolatrous Priests; for why should a Law be made so severely against Witches if there had been none? or why should the Scripture record so perculiar a Story of the witch of Endor if she had known no more then some few tricks of Legerdemain, and had not had a particular Converse with Infernal Spirits.

I say, notwithstanding all the Clutter these men have made to itnroduce this unbelief of withces into the World, by <normalised orig="alledging" auto="true">alleging</normalised> first that there is no such ting as a witch in Scripture. And SEcondly that there of Witchcraft first took Birth from Heathen Fables, and was afterwards improved by Popish Impostures, and laughing at all the strange and wonderful stories realted by so many credible witnesses in confirmation of it, yet certainly there are such lewd and wicked people, hwo give themselves over to the Dominion of the Prince of the Power of the Air to have his aid and affiliation in execution their Malice and Revenge; of what follows will be a very pregnant Testimony, which being so less true than it is sad and wonderful. 

There lived and still <normalised orig="liveth" auto="true">lives</normalised> in the Town of Eastcoat near Fosters-Booth in Northampton Shire, a Rich and substantial Grzier, who ahppening about April last, (when Mutton was very dear and scarce) to have killed a sheep for the use of his own Family, there came into his house an old woman who long had been observed to be muttering ot her self, came into his House, and would needs have some of his Mutton, but he neither willing to spare it, nor she to give the price it was then owrth, he utterly refused to let her have any; whereupon she went away murmerring and grumbling, and told him he had as good have done what she desired, and took her money; He took so little notice of what she said, that some few days after he did not all remember it, when it happened, that going into his pasture he found thirty of his sheep in a condition dead, and in a strange and miserable manner, their <normalised orig="leggs" auto="true">legs</normalised> broke in pieces, and their bones all shattered in their skins, whereupon amazed at the strangeness of the spectacles, he sent for several of his <normalised orig="neighbors" auto="true">neighbours</normalised> to view them, who no less <normalised orig="wondring" auto="true">wondering</normalised> at it then he, <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> into a <normalised orig="suspition" auto="true">suspicion</normalised> that they must needs be bewiched, and advised him to take on of them and burn it, for they said, that they had heard it confidently affirmed by Men of reputed knowledge, that upon doing so the Witch would appear; Whereupon, the honest Grazier, over-perswaded by his Neighbours, took one of the Sheep and threw it into the fire; but though they could by no means burn it, yet they immediately came the same old Woman <normalised orig="runing" auto="true">running</normalised> in a great hurry, that would some days before have brought some of this Mutton, and in a mighty Chase, asked him what he meant, to offer to burn his sheep, which fully increasing his <normalised orig="suspition" auto="true">suspicion</normalised>, having a Knife in hand, and led, perhaps by that general opinion, that fetching Blood of the Witch takes a way her power of doing any hearm, he gave her a little cut over the hand and fetching blood of her, she little regarding and neglecting to apply and rememdy to it, it <normalised orig="wrankled" auto="true">wrinkled</normalised> and <normalised orig="swell'd" auto="true">swelled</normalised> <normalised orig="extreamly" auto="true">extremely</normalised>, whereupon she came again, and <normalised orig="threatned" auto="true">threatened</normalised> that she would arrest and trouble him for it; and he to avoid any thing of trouble, being a quiet Man, was content to give her twenty shillings towards her cure, which she had no sooner received of him, but she returned these or the like words, that that was the <normalised orig="Divils" auto="true">Devils</normalised> <normalised orig="mony" auto="true">money</normalised>, and that now she had power enough to punish him, nor did she delay to execute her Malice, but soon after, being afflicted by Satan, her Colleague, about the 22th of May last set his House and Barns on fire; and notwithstanding all the help of his <normalised orig="Neighbors" auto="true">Neighbours</normalised> to quench it, they could nothing prevail, but that one of his Barnes was quite burnt to the ground, and sometiems the fire would be in his what, and osmetimes in his Chambers, os that htye knew not which way to turn themselves to extinguish it, at length with much pain and labour and the good Spirit prevailing over the bad, they made a shift to put it out. Without any considerable damage to his household Goods, save only the Barn before mentioned, was quite consumed; amnong the rest of the Neighbours that came to assist at this fire, came likewise this old woman, who was observed to tell several of the others, that all they did, was but in <normalised orig="vaine" auto="true">vain</normalised>, and that do what they could, they should never be able to quench the fire, wehreupon they were more and more confrimed in the former strong presumptions they had, that all this mischief was done by her devilish Art, and thereupon laying hands on this suspected witch, carried her before the next Justice of the Peace, where b eing charged for having by Devilish practices and combination with the Price of Darkness; first caused this poor mans Sheep to die in that strange and miserable manner, and <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterword</normalised> to have kindled the fire in his Barnes and Houses, she freely confressed all, and boasted that she would make many more die as well as her self: Upon which confession of hers, she was by Mittimus from the Justice of the Peace committed to the Northampton Goal, there to remain till the next Assizes.

No sooner was she brought in, but the Keeprs of the Goal caused her to be chained close to a post that was in the Goal; but she had not been long so tied before she began to swell in all parts of her body, that her skin was ready to burst, which caused her to cry out in a most lamentable manner, insomuch that they were forced to Unchain her again, and to give her more Liberty that the devil might come to suck her, the which he usually did, coming constantly about the dead time of the Night in the likeness of a Rat, which at his coming, made a most lamentable and hideous noise which affrighted the people that did belong to the Goal, which caused many to come and see her during her abode there, and several hath been with her when the Devil hath been coming to her, but could see nothing but things like Rats, and heard a most terrible Noise; Not long after, the assizes being come, this witch that went by the name of Ann Foster, was called to the Bar, and being asked whether she were guilty of those Crimes that there were <normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised> against her: She at the first pleaded not guilty, but it beng so evidently proved that she was the person that had committed all those things before mentioned, she then confessed, and said that the Devil did provoke her to do all those MIschiefs, and Seeing that setence of death was past upon her, she prayed to God to forgive her and desired the Man (on whom she had so much spent her Malice, which was to the <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> of him) to forigve her likewise, for she could no way make him amends but only by satisfying the Law, according to the sentence which was pronounced <normalised orig="aginst" auto="true">against</normalised> her. She said that she could bring out many more that were as bad as herself. After Sentence of death was past upon her, she mightily desired to be Burned; but the court would give no Ear to that, but that she should be hanged at the common place of Execution, which accordingly was performed on Saturday last being the 22th of this Instant August.
