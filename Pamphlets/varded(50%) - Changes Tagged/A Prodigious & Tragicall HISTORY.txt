LONDON, Printed for Richard Harper, in Smithfield. 1652.

Kent the first Christian, last conquered, and one of the most <normalised orig="flou" auto="true">floe</normalised>∣rishing and fruitful Provinces of England, is the Scene, and the <normalised orig="beautifull" auto="true">beautiful</normalised> Town of Maidstone, the Stage, whereon this <normalised orig="Tragicall" auto="true">Tragical</normalised> Story was <normalised orig="publickly" auto="true">publicly</normalised> acted, at Maidstone Assizes, last past.

AMongst many others that then made their entrance, and were presented as suspe∣cted of Witch-craft, before the Reve∣rend and honourable Judge Warburton, who then sate Judge over <normalised orig="criminall" auto="true">criminal</normalised> Of∣fendors: the most notorious were, Anne Ashby, alias <normalised orig="Cobler" auto="true">Cobbler</normalised>, Anne <normalised orig="Martyn" auto="true">Martin</normalised>, Mary Browne, Mildred Wright, and Anne Wilson, all of Cranbrooke, a Market Town in Kent, and Mary Read of Lenham in the same County; all which were convicted of the exe∣crable and <normalised orig="Diabolicall" auto="true">Diabolical</normalised> crime of Witch-craft, and for the same received sentence of death, on Friday the 30. day of July last; of whose actions and confessions I shall give you a few particulars, but those you will <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>, very rare and remarkable.

Anne Ashby alias <normalised orig="Cobler" auto="true">Cobbler</normalised>, who was the chief <normalised orig="Actresse" auto="true">Actress</normalised>, and who had the greatest part in this Tragedy, and Anne <normalised orig="Martyn" auto="true">Martin</normalised>, confessed at the time of their <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised>, that the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> had known them carnally, and that they had no hurt by it.

The said Ashby alias <normalised orig="Cobler" auto="true">Cobbler</normalised>, in view of this <normalised orig="Observa" auto="true">Observe</normalised>∣tor, fell into an <normalised orig="extasie" auto="true">ecstasy</normalised> before the Bench, and <normalised orig="swell'd" auto="true">swelled</normalised> into a monstrous and vast bigness, screeching and crying out very dolefully; and being recovered, and demanded if the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> at that time had possessed her, she <normalised orig="replyed" auto="true">replied</normalised> she knew not that, but she said that the spirit Rug came out of her mouth like a Mouse.
And further concerning this spirit Rug, it is reported, that the said Ashby alias <normalised orig="Cobler" auto="true">Cobbler</normalised> being under Examination before a Justice of Peace, before whom she was carried by certain <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> of <normalised orig="Colonell" auto="true">Colonel</normalised> Humfreys Regiment; at the same time of her examination, a certain Groom that was in presence said come Rug into my mouth, which Groom, as it is reported, died within a fortnight after, near unto the City of London.

The said Anne Ashby further confessed, that the Di∣vell had given them a piece of flesh, which whensoe∣ver they should touch, they should thereby affect their desires.

That this flesh lay hid amongst <normalised orig="grasse" auto="true">grass</normalised>, in a certain place which she named, where upon search it was found accordingly.

This flesh was of a <normalised orig="sinnewy" auto="true">sinewy</normalised> substance, and scorched, and was seen and felt by this Observator, and reserved for <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> view, at the sign of the Swan in Maidstone.

The said Anne Ashby, Anne <normalised orig="Martyn" auto="true">Martin</normalised>, and one other of their Associates, after they were cast, and upon the pronunciation of Judgement against them, pleaded that they were with child pregnant, but confessed it was not by any man, but by the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised>.

One Dock of Gresham, alias Cresham, Doctor to Anne Ashby, is committed to close imprisonment, and not per∣<normalised orig="mitted" auto="true">meted</normalised>

to speak with any person, without the presence of his Keeper.
A Pin being thrust to the head into one of their arms, the party did not <normalised orig="feele" auto="true">feel</normalised> it, neither did it draw <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> from her, which was Mary Browne, Anne Wilson, or Mildred Wright.

Mary Read of Lenham had a visible Teat under her tongue, and did <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> it to many, and it was likewise seen by this Observator.

It is likewise to be noted, that the aforesaid Anne Ashby, alias <normalised orig="Cobler" auto="true">Cobbler</normalised>, during the time of her <normalised orig="extasie" auto="true">ecstasy</normalised>, when she <normalised orig="swell'd" auto="true">swelled</normalised> in that prodigious manner before mentioned, uttered many speeches which did greatly amaze and astonish the Auditory, proceeding from her in that manner, of which there was no small number of Wit∣<normalised orig="nesses" auto="true">noses</normalised>, in so great and <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> a confluence of people, some of which the Observator <normalised orig="remembreth" auto="true">remembers</normalised>, but for∣bears at present to set down the particulars.

So upon the proceedings aforesaid, and the evidences brought in against them, the said Anne Ashby, alias <normalised orig="Cobler" auto="true">Cobbler</normalised>, Anne <normalised orig="Martyn" auto="true">Martin</normalised>, Mary Browne, Anne Wilson, and Mildred Wright of Cranbrook, and Mary Read of Lenham, being legally convicted, were according to the Laws of this Nation, adjudged to be hanged, at the common place of Execution.

Some there were that wished rather they might be burnt to Ashes; <normalised orig="alledging" auto="true">alleging</normalised>, that it was a received <normalised orig="opi" auto="true">open</normalised>∣<normalised orig="nion" auto="true">neon</normalised> amongst many, that the body of a Witch being burnt, her <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> is prevented thereby from <normalised orig="becomming" auto="true">becoming</normalised> hereditary to her Progeny in the same <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised>, which by hanging is not; but whether this opinion be erroneous, or not, I am not to dispute.

Besides these former six condemned Witches, there were at the same time some others of Greanes Arraign∣ed, who although sentence of death did not then <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> against them, yet one whose name was Creed, was by three <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> Indictments found guilty by the Grand Jury, consisting of persons of good integrity, and estates. And in the aforesaid black List, were <normalised orig="mustred" auto="true">mustered</normalised> one Rey∣nolds, and one Wilson, with both their Wives.
It is supposed that nine children, besides a man and a woman, were bewitched; 500 pounds worth of <normalised orig="Cattel" auto="true">Cattle</normalised> lost, and much Corn at Sea <normalised orig="wrack'd" auto="true">wracked</normalised>, by Witchcraft.

They confessed they had bewitched a child, that had been languishing along time; this child died about the time of their trials, whose <normalised orig="pourtraicture" auto="true">portraiture</normalised> in wax was found, where they had laid it, under the Threshold of a <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>.

To this discourse the bodies of three Children lately found at Chatham, may have some reference, which however it will not be much <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised> to insert here; al∣though it be <normalised orig="doubtfull" auto="true">doubtful</normalised>, whether their deaths be to be attributed to Sorcery, or any other violent means; two of these bodies appeared but in part, the rest being con∣sumed; the third was the entire body of a Male-child, having a <normalised orig="Navell" auto="true">Navel</normalised> five inches long.

And here you may observe the hellish and <normalised orig="infernall" auto="true">infernal</normalised> estate of those wretched deluded people, <normalised orig="calld" auto="true">called</normalised> Witches, whom their Grand-master the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, at one time or other leaves in the lurch; as here you may perceive in the Story of these miserable Wretches, who deserved∣<normalised orig="ly" auto="true">lie</normalised> received the Sentence of Condemnation, as <normalised orig="afore" auto="true">before</normalised>∣<normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>; for it is written, Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live.

A true Relation of one Mrs. Atkins, a Mercers Wife in Warwick, who was strangely carried away from her house in July last, and hath not been heard of since.
IN Warwick Town one Mrs. Katherine Atkins, a Mer∣cers Wife, standing at her door on Saturday night, the 24. July, 1652. A certain unknown Woman came to her and <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised>, pray give me two-pence, she answered, two-pences are not so <normalised orig="plentifull" auto="true">plentiful</normalised>, and that she would give her no <normalised orig="Mony" auto="true">Money</normalised>. Pray <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised>, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, then give me that Pin, so she took the Pin off her sleeve and gave her, for which she was very <normalised orig="thankfull" auto="true">thankful</normalised>, and was going away. <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Atkins seeing her so <normalised orig="thankfull" auto="true">thankful</normalised> for a Pin, called her again, and told her if she would stay, she would fetch some Victuals for her, or give her some thread, or some∣thing out of the shop. She answered, she would have nothing else, and bid a pox of her Victuals, and swore (by God) saying, You shall be an hundred miles off within this week, when you shall want two-pence as much as I, and so she went grumbling away.

Hereupon the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Atkins was much troubled in mind, and did advise with some Friends what were best to be done in such a case, but receiving no resolution from any one what to do, she attended the Event what might befall within such a time, and upon the 29. of July, she <normalised orig="exprest" auto="true">expressed</normalised> to a Kinsman Mr. Nicholas <normalised orig="Bikar" auto="true">Biker</normalised>, that she was much troubled about the <normalised orig="foresayd" auto="true">foresaid</normalised> <normalised orig="businesse" auto="true">business</normalised>, but hoped the time was so near expired, that it would come to nothing.


But the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> Thursday night betwixt the <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised> of 8. and 9. She going into the Shop, and returning thence in the Entry ad∣<normalised orig="joyning" auto="true">joining</normalised> to the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> Shop, she was immediately gone, by what means and whither we do not know, nor can we hear of upon en∣quiry made to this present.
The desire of her Husband and Friends is of all the Inhabi∣tants of this Nation, That if they hear of any such party in such a lost condition as is before expressed: That there may be speedy notice given thereof to her Husband in Warwick, and that all convenient provisions both of Horse and <normalised orig="mony" auto="true">money</normalised> may be made for the conveying of her to the place <normalised orig="aforesayd" auto="true">aforesaid</normalised>, and such as shall take pains, or be at <normalised orig="expences" auto="true">expenses</normalised> herein shall be sufficiently re∣compenced for the same, with many thanks.

It's likewise desired that the Ministers in London, and else∣where, where the notice of these presents shall come, would be pleased to present her sad condition to God in their <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> Con∣gregations. The truth hereof we <normalised orig="testifie" auto="true">testify</normalised>, whose names are sub∣scribed.
