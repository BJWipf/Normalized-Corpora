A True Account of the <normalised orig="Tryals" auto="true">Trials</normalised> and Con∣fessions of several WITCHES, in New-England, &c.

In a Letter to a Friend.
SIR,
SInce in Scripture, and divers Histories, we find that by the Delusion and Temptation of the Devil, silly Creatures are drawn aside to com∣ply with a <normalised orig="Diabolick" auto="true">Diabolic</normalised> Power, out of Revenge, to mischief their Fellow-Creatures; and other sinister Designs; it may not prove ungrateful to the Age, among other Matters of this kind, to give an Impar∣<normalised orig="tial" auto="true">teal</normalised> Account of divers Persons who have been lately <normalised orig="Try'd" auto="true">Tried</normalised>, Convicted and Executed in New-England, for their Bewitching, Torturing and Destroying People and Cattle; with many strange and amazing Circum∣stances that attended the Effecting of their hellish Per∣formances. And, First,

At a Sessions of <normalised orig="Oyer" auto="true">Over</normalised> and Terminer, Bridget Bishop was <normalised orig="Try'd" auto="true">Tried</normalised>, for Bewitching and Hurting divers Persons, and Destroying their Cattle. Against whom, upon Evidence, it <normalised orig="appear'd" auto="true">appeared</normalised> in Court, That she, or some∣thing in her shape, often came and pinched and bit several Persons, grievously tormenting and affrighting them, urging them to write their Names in a Book which was then <normalised orig="produc'd" auto="true">produced</normalised>; and one refusing it, was <normalised orig="carry'd" auto="true">carried</normalised> by force from her Wheel, and <normalised orig="threatned" auto="true">threatened</normalised> to be <normalised orig="drown'd" auto="true">drowned</normalised> in a River, if she did not Sign it; but she

overcame the Temptation: And that Bishop boasted she had been the death of divers People. And those she had <normalised orig="bewitch'd" auto="true">bewitched</normalised>, when at any time she <normalised orig="look'd" auto="true">looked</normalised> upon them, were extremely <normalised orig="tortur'd" auto="true">tortured</normalised>; and when they were in a Swoon, if she <normalised orig="touch'd" auto="true">touched</normalised> them, they would <normalised orig="imme" auto="true">emma</normalised>∣diately revive, and many the like Gestures, <normalised orig="work'd" auto="true">worked</normalised> strange Effects. Once she tempted one Deliverance <normalised orig="Hobbs" auto="true">Hobs</normalised> to Sign the Book she brought; and because she refused, a Spectre, in the Shape of Bishop, <normalised orig="whip'd" auto="true">whipped</normalised> her with Iron Rods; and that she knew this Woman to be at a General Meeting of Witches, in a Field near a Village <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> <normalised orig="Salem" auto="true">Solemn</normalised>; and that there she took Bread and Wine in a Diabolical way, as a Sacrament. John Cook said, upon Oath, That he was assaulted by her Shape in his Chamber; which hit him a blow on the Head, and made an Apple fly out of his Hand into his Mother's Lap, at a great distance.
Her shape was often seen in a great Light, which <normalised orig="appear'd" auto="true">appeared</normalised> with her, so that she might easily be <normalised orig="discern'd" auto="true">discerned</normalised>. John <normalised orig="Blys's" auto="true">Bliss's</normalised> Wife Testified, That having bought a Sow of Bishop's Husband, and the Money be∣ing <normalised orig="pay'd" auto="true">paid</normalised> to another Person, the Sow was soon after taken with strange Fits, Leaping and Jumping, and beating her Head against the places where she came, refusing her meat, &c.

She was held to bewitch a Child of one Samuel Shattock's, and when she payed the said Shattock mo∣ney, it was unaccountably conveyed away, though Locked never so safely up, she oppressed one John Lou∣der in the night, and had like to have <normalised orig="destroy'd" auto="true">destroyed</normalised> him; and after that, he being at home, and the doors shut, a black Pig, or rather the Devil in such a shape, ap∣pear'd to him, which he going to kick, it vanished, as he thought, out of the Window: then a black thing Jumped in again, with a Body like a Monkey, the

Face something like a Man, and the feet like a Cocks, which in the midst of his affrighment, told him, That understanding he was in trouble, he come as a <normalised orig="Messen" auto="true">Mizzen</normalised>∣ger to tell him, that if he would be ruled by him, he should want nothing in the World; whereupon endea∣vouring to seize it, he could feel no substance it seem∣ing to Jump out of the Window again, and then com∣ing to the Porch, said, You had better take my Coun∣<normalised orig="sel" auto="true">sell</normalised>. He then struck at it with a Stick, but the Stick broke, and it Vanishing, his Arm was disabled, and <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterword</normalised> throwing dirt upon his Breast, it struck him Dumb for three Days.
Many other things of the like nature were <normalised orig="testifyed" auto="true">testified</normalised> against her. As that she appeared several times with a strange Light, and upon her with-drawing, it was Dark. That one Stacy being <normalised orig="threatned" auto="true">threatened</normalised> by her, was one dark Night thrown against a Stone-Wall, and down a Bank, &c. His Horse-traces breaking in pieces, and he not being able to lift up two Bushels of Corn, though otherwise a Strong Man. It was suspected she killed this Party's Daughter by Witchcraft, and it was pro∣ved that in taking down an old Cellar-Wall of hers, Poppets made of Clouts and Hogs-Hair, were found stuck with headless-pins. To these Accusations and Proofs against her, she made little Defence.

<normalised orig="Susanna" auto="true">Suzanne</normalised> Martin was <normalised orig="Tryed" auto="true">Tried</normalised> upon the same account, and the People that were to appear against her, found themselves upon their looking at her, in a strange dis∣order, falling down when they came to approach her, and being asked the reason, she gave a very slight An∣swer.

Against her it was proved, that one John Allen, re∣fusing to carry her some Staves, by reason of the weak∣<normalised orig="ness" auto="true">nos</normalised> of his Oxen that drove his Wain, she told him he had better he had; and soon after one of his Oxen tired:
but this was not all, putting his Oxen to pasture among others, they first took a River, and then being reco∣<normalised orig="vered" auto="true">veered</normalised>, they ran into the Sea, where they were all drowned but one, which for a time run Mad.
John Atkinson, having bought a Cow of this Wo∣man's Son, and she being displeased at the Bargain, though this Cow was <normalised orig="Ham-string'd" auto="true">Hamstringed</normalised> and <normalised orig="halter'd" auto="true">haltered</normalised>, she grew so Mad, that she broke all the Ropes, and though <normalised orig="tyed" auto="true">tied</normalised> to a Tree, she got away. Bernard Peche, <normalised orig="testifi" auto="true">testify</normalised>∣ed, That she came in at his Window one Night, and lay upon him for two hours, when recovering himself, he got hold of her Hand, and bit her by the Finger, so that she going down Stairs, drops of Blood were found, and the prints of her feet in the Snow at the threshold, but no farther. Once she and another assaulted him in his Barn, where he knocked them down with a Quarter-Staff, but they rose up and got away, and having threat∣ned one time, to send a she-Devil to fetch him away, a Cat soon after came in at the Window, and took hold on his Throat, when calling upon the Name of God, it flew out of the Window. Also falling out with one Kembal, for his refusing to buy a Puppy of her, she said he should have Puppies enough, and one day coming home, he was by an invisible Power, driven out of the Road upon stumps of Trees, and immedi∣<normalised orig="ately" auto="true">italy</normalised> a Puppy shot too and fro between his Legs, and sometimes over his Shoulder, which he could not hit, though often with his Ax he struck, at it: soon after a∣<normalised orig="nother" auto="true">another</normalised>, bigger appeared, and flew at him with great fierceness, when calling upon the Name of Christ, it vanished; and though Kembal told it to no body, yet Martin, the Prisoner, declared how he had been served.

One Pressy, gave Evidence against this Woman, that coming home one Night, he saw a little out of his way a great Light, to which going and striking at it, he


found it a solid Body, and giving it many blows, he had not gone far from it, but Martin appeared, and the next day he heard she was Ill of blows and hurts received. One Ring Testified that she came to him one Night, and bit him by the fingers, the mark of which was produced in Court.
Elizabeth How, was likewise <normalised orig="Tryed" auto="true">Tried</normalised> at the same Court for a Witch, and it appeared against her that her evil looks cast People into swooning fits, and many great disorders. That she bewitched one Stafford's Wife, and Child bewitched her Brother's Cattle to Death and the Cattle of divers other Peo∣ple Miscarried by her Curses, and bad Wishes, and if any displeased, her one mischief or other <normalised orig="befel" auto="true">befell</normalised> them, and one Sherwin's Wife dying, charged her to have a hand in her Death by Witchcraft.

She bewitched and killed a Mare of one Cumings, and a Daughter of <normalised orig="Tymothy" auto="true">Timothy</normalised> Pearly's, the Girl affirming to her Death, that this Woman had bewitched her, and would be in a strange taking, when even she was named, saying at the last, Though she could torment her Body, she could not hurt her Soul. Divers recanting Witches came in against her, and declared, that she had been <normalised orig="Baptized" auto="true">Baptised</normalised> with them by the Devil, whereup∣on they kneeled down and Worshipped him.

Martha Carrier, was another who was <normalised orig="Tryed" auto="true">Tried</normalised> at this Court upon the like account, and against her it was proved by several Persons, whom she had bewitched, that they had been by her, or something in her shape, bit, pinched, and almost <normalised orig="choaked" auto="true">choked</normalised>, and even upon her Examination and <normalised orig="Tryal" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, her looks and gestures struck them into strange <normalised orig="Consternations" auto="true">Consternation</normalised> and Disorders their Necks turning wildly about, at which she scoffingly declared, it were no matter if their Necks were twi∣sted off. Her own Children had declared that she had brought them up to the same mischievous ends, decla∣ring

how and where they had been upon these wicked designs, and what mischief they had done.
She falling out with one Abbot, about measuring of Ground, he after her <normalised orig="threatning" auto="true">threatening</normalised> of him, had a swelling in his Foot, then a pain in his Side, and many other grievous sores fell upon him, which brought him al∣most to his Grave, till such times as this Woman was apprehended, and then he recovered. His Cattle many of them were taken away, by strange and unusual Deaths. One Toothmaker likewise lost many Cattle upon falling out with her, and having a Wound, she told him it should never be Cured, which indeed could not be effected, till the time of her being seized, and then it immediately grew well. Likewise the Cattle of John Rogers were bewitched upon his falling out with her, and divers other People suffered the like: She ta∣king one Phoebe Chandler by the Shoulder, soon after she heard a Voice over her Head, saying, In a few Days she should be <normalised orig="poyson'd" auto="true">poisoned</normalised>; and thereupon her Hand <normalised orig="swel" auto="true">swell</normalised>∣led, and she was in many great pains and torments. Divers Women that had been of her Conversation, ac∣<normalised orig="cus'd" auto="true">cussed</normalised> her being at Witch-Meetings, and of Eating and Drinking with the Devil; and, that she drew some of them into the Snare.

One thing strangely <normalised orig="happen'd" auto="true">happened</normalised>, during her <normalised orig="Tryal" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, viz. One <normalised orig="Susanna" auto="true">Suzanne</normalised> Sheldon had her Hands tied together with a Whale-Bone by an Invisible Hand, that it could not be undone without cutting; and for this Service of Carrier, the Devil <normalised orig="promis'd" auto="true">promised</normalised> to make her Queen of Hell.

Among these Women, a Man was <normalised orig="Try'd" auto="true">Tried</normalised>, as a Dealer in the Black-Art, and Witchcraft. It <normalised orig="appear'd" auto="true">appeared</normalised> against him, That he had <normalised orig="intic'd" auto="true">enticed</normalised> a great many to sign the Devil's Book with Blood, or some <normalised orig="Necromantick" auto="true">Necromantic</normalised> Matter. He was suspected to make away Two Wives by Witchcraft; whose Ghosts <normalised orig="appear'd" auto="true">appeared</normalised>, and <normalised orig="declar'd" auto="true">declared</normalised>
as much to divers People, charging them to reveal it; and <normalised orig="tho'" auto="true">though</normalised> he was but a weak Man to appearance, yet he would lift more than the strongest Man could do. So that it was <normalised orig="conjectur'd" auto="true">conjectured</normalised>, that the Devil must of necessity assist him by a secret power. It <normalised orig="appear'd" auto="true">appeared</normalised> against him, that he had <normalised orig="intic'd" auto="true">enticed</normalised> many into Witchery; and One re∣fusing to sign his Book, was afflicted with cruel Pains for a long time. Some he bit, and the print of his Teeth remained in their Flesh. And it further ap∣pear'd, that he was the chief Summoner to the Witch-Meetings, and persuaded People to communicate with the Devil; and many other horrible things, as de∣stroying of Cattle, and the like.
So that upon full Evidence against them all, they were Convicted, and <normalised orig="receiv'd" auto="true">received</normalised> Sentence of Death, and were accordingly executed: But several Children, and others, that had been <normalised orig="seduc'd" auto="true">seduced</normalised> by them to these <normalised orig="hel" auto="true">hell</normalised>∣lish Practices, met with lighter Punishments, and have Time allowed them to repent.
