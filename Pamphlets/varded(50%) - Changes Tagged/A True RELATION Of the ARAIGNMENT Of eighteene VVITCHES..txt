A true And perfect Relation of the Witches that were <normalised orig="araigned" auto="true">arraigned</normalised>, <normalised orig="tryed" auto="true">tried</normalised>, and convicted, at a Sessions holden at St. Edmunds-bury in <normalised orig="Suffolke" auto="true">Suffolk</normalised>; and there by the Judge of the Sessions condemned to dye, and so were executed the 27. day of Aug. last 1645.
THIS above-named Mr. Lowes Parson of Branson in <normalised orig="Suffolke" auto="true">Suffolk</normalised>, (being <normalised orig="araigned" auto="true">arraigned</normalised> there for witch-craft,) confessed that he bewitched a Ship <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> Harwidge, so that with the <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> <normalised orig="tempesteous" auto="true">tempestuous</normalised> Seas raised by blusterous <normalised orig="windes" auto="true">winds</normalised> the said Ship was cast away, wherein were many passengers, who were by this <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> swallowed up by the <normalised orig="mercilesse" auto="true">merciless</normalised> waves, further he confessed that he had done many other most hanous, wicked, and accursed acts, by the help of six Jmpes which he had that frequented him daily. This Mr. Lowes preached about threescore sermons after he had made his <normalised orig="Covenent" auto="true">Covenant</normalised> with the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, and had a teat on the <normalised orig="crowne" auto="true">crown</normalised> of his head, and two under his tongue: and there is none that <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised> a Covenant with the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> but hath from him a private <normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised>.

Also Thomas Evererd a Cooper, and Mary his wife, both being <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised> in a Brewhouse at Halsworth in the County of <normalised orig="Suffolke" auto="true">Suffolk</normalised>, freely confessed that they had bewitched <normalised orig="Beere" auto="true">Beer</normalised> in that Brewhouse: and that the <normalised orig="odiousnesse" auto="true">odiousness</normalised> of the infectious <normalised orig="stinke" auto="true">stink</normalised> of it was such & so <normalised orig="intollerable" auto="true">intolerable</normalised> that by the noysomnesse of the <normalised orig="smel" auto="true">smell</normalised> or <normalised orig="tast" auto="true">taste</normalised> many people dyed. And they further said that many other

<normalised orig="mischiefes" auto="true">mischiefs</normalised> they had perpetrated and acted by their witchcrafts and damnable Sorceries, and that they also had their Jmpes to whom they gave suck.
One old woman confessed that she had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a Witch the space of above fifty <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, in which time she also <normalised orig="confest" auto="true">confessed</normalised> that she had done many very wicked things in bewitching <normalised orig="Cattell" auto="true">Cattle</normalised>, <normalised orig="Corne" auto="true">Corn</normalised>â–ª &c. but above all that she had bewitched seven persons of one family to death to wit, a man together with his wife and five childrens and that also she had her Jmpes which came to her in <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> shapes.

Another of the women Witches consessed that she had bewitched a child to death, and that she had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a Witch above five and twenty <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, in which time she had bewitched great store of Cattle so that the owners of them were much impoverished and <normalised orig="hindred" auto="true">hindered</normalised> both by the death of them sometimes; and sometimes by the unserviceablenesse of them. And also she <normalised orig="confest" auto="true">confessed</normalised> that she usually bewitched standing <normalised orig="corne" auto="true">corn</normalised>, whereby there came great losses to the owners thereof, for that they could <normalised orig="reape" auto="true">reap</normalised> no profit, nor the benefit of there long, hard, and by her made, <normalised orig="fruitlesse" auto="true">fruitless</normalised> labours: besides she confessed that she had committed many other such like <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> deeds to the hinderance of many.

These and all the rest confessed that <normalised orig="cruell" auto="true">cruel</normalised> malice and he bred <normalised orig="envie" auto="true">envy</normalised> was their <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised> delight, continually a long time before they made their Covenant with the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, who also did often and sundry times and in <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> shapes <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> to them, before they entered into Covenant with him that they might be made Witches.

Further also these with all the rest being searched as they were taken, were found by the searchers to have Teats or Dugs which their Jmpes used to suck so often as they came to them. And that some of them had such <normalised orig="Teates" auto="true">Teats</normalised> or Dugs under their <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, some under their tongue, some in the <normalised orig="roofe" auto="true">roof</normalised> of their mouth, some on the crown of the head some amongst their toes, some in their fundament, and divers other places: their Teats were but little, some of them are shaped like a thunderbolt. These <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> teats or dugs their <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> Jmpes used to suck who came to them often Sometimes in the shape of Mice, sometimes in the shape of <normalised orig="Kitens" auto="true">Kittens</normalised>, sometimes in the shape of <normalised orig="Snayles" auto="true">Snails</normalised>, and other-while in,
the shape of Snakes, Hornets, <normalised orig="Waspes" auto="true">Wasps</normalised>, and divers other shapes.
Besides these are 120. more suspected Witches in prison, at St. Edmunds-bury, who had all their <normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised> now: but that the Judge and Justices were compelled to <normalised orig="adjourne" auto="true">adjourn</normalised> the said Sessions till another time by reason of the <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> <normalised orig="aproaching" auto="true">approaching</normalised> of the Cavaliers. And of those Witches some have confessed that they have had <normalised orig="carnall" auto="true">carnal</normalised> copulation with the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, one of which said that she had (before her husband dyed) conceived twice by him, but as <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as she was delivered of them they run away in most horrid long and ugly shapes.

And these confessed that they have bewitched divers Men, Women, and Children to death, as also, Horses, Oxen, <normalised orig="Cowes" auto="true">Cows</normalised>, Sheep Swine, and other sort of <normalised orig="Cattell" auto="true">Cattle</normalised>, as likewise <normalised orig="Corne" auto="true">Corn</normalised>, <normalised orig="Herbes" auto="true">Herbs</normalised>, and plants &c. and have raised great and very <normalised orig="tempestious" auto="true">tempestuous</normalised> <normalised orig="windes" auto="true">winds</normalised> and <normalised orig="stormes" auto="true">storms</normalised>, to the overthrowing and <normalised orig="subuerting" auto="true">subverting</normalised> of Houses, Stables, Barnes, Stacks of <normalised orig="Corne" auto="true">Corn</normalised>, and Hay with Trees, &c.

Another of these Witches by her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> confession affirmed that she owing a <normalised orig="grudg" auto="true">grudge</normalised> to a Gentleman and his wife in <normalised orig="Suffolke" auto="true">Suffolk</normalised>, having no occasion (but that they seemed discontented at her <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> often to their house, and wishing her to <normalised orig="forbeare" auto="true">forbear</normalised> <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised>) and <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> for this cause she sent one of her Jmpes in the <normalised orig="likenesse" auto="true">likeness</normalised> of a little black <normalised orig="smoth" auto="true">smooth</normalised> Dog to play with their Boy being very young and their <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> child But the child at first refused to play with it, but it <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> often, at the length the Child made much of it till at last the Jmpe brought the child to a water side, and there drowned the said child to the great grief of the parents.

Amongst those remaining yet in prison there is one Witch they say to be burned, who <normalised orig="seemeth" auto="true">seems</normalised> to be very penitent for her former lewd and abominable <normalised orig="indevours" auto="true">endeavours</normalised>, and acts, and desires to have Petitions put up to divers godly Ministers that they would be pleased to pray in their <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> Congregations that her said Jmpes may have no further power, to do any more such like hurt, neither by Sea nor Land, as they have divers times formerly done, to the destruction, <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised>, or utter undoing of many sundry good and honest people,
Now for the manner how they usually find out these Witches.
THere are in the County of <normalised orig="Suffolke" auto="true">Suffolk</normalised> <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> searchers appointed for the finding of them out, two men searchers and two women searchers, the men are to search those men who are suspected to be Witches, and the women searchers likewise are to search those women that are supposed to be Witches.

And also their <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> is, in what Town soever in the said County of <normalised orig="Suffolke" auto="true">Suffolk</normalised>, there be any person or persons suspected to bewitch or Witches, thither they send for two or all of the said searchers, who take the <normalised orig="partie" auto="true">party</normalised> or parties so suspected into a <normalised orig="Roome" auto="true">Room</normalised> & strip him, her, or them, <normalised orig="starke" auto="true">stark</normalised> naked, and on whom the searchers find any teats or dugs, that <normalised orig="partie" auto="true">party</normalised> or parties, the said searchers set upon a <normalised orig="stoole" auto="true">stool</normalised> or <normalised orig="stooles" auto="true">stools</normalised>, in the midst of the <normalised orig="Roome" auto="true">Room</normalised>, so that the <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised> of him, her, or them, may not touch the ground. <normalised orig="Neverthelesse" auto="true">Nevertheless</normalised> the party or parties may sometimes <normalised orig="walke" auto="true">walk</normalised> up and down the said <normalised orig="Roome" auto="true">Room</normalised>, so that there be sure watch kept, that none of his, her, or their <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> come at him, her, or them, to suck him, her, or any one of them so suspected, during the space of <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> and twenty <normalised orig="houers" auto="true">hovers</normalised> and in that time (if they be Witches) either their <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> will come to suck him, her, or them, or else the <normalised orig="partie" auto="true">party</normalised> or parties that is a Witch or Witches will he mightily perplexed and much tortured for want of his, her, or their sucking <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised>, and will be strangely
out of order, and <normalised orig="fome" auto="true">some</normalised> at mouth, or else be infome other extraordinary seeming tormented posture, and many times they do apparently see their <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> come to them.

The Examination of Anno Leech of <normalised orig="Misley" auto="true">Mislay</normalised> in the County aforesaid, widow, taken before the said Justices, <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised> 14. 1645.
THis Examinant saith; That she had a gray Jmpe sent to her, and that this Examinant, together with the said Elizabeth Clarke, and Elizabeth, the wife of Edward Gooding, did about a <normalised orig="yeer" auto="true">year</normalised> since, send their Jmpes to kill a black <normalised orig="Cowe" auto="true">Cow</normalised> and a white <normalised orig="Cowe" auto="true">Cow</normalised> of Mr. Edwards which was done accordingly: And this Examinant saith, that she sent her gray Jmpe, Elizabeth Clarke a black Jmpe, and Elizabeth Gooding a white Jmpe: And this Examinant saith. that about thirty <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> since, she sent a gray Jmp to kill two Horses of one Mr. <normalised orig="Bragge" auto="true">Brag</normalised> of <normalised orig="Misley" auto="true">Mislay</normalised>, which were killed accordingly; and that the occasion of her Malice was, because <normalised orig="Mistrisse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Bragge" auto="true">Brag</normalised> had told this Examinant, that she suspected her to be a naughty woman; this Examinant confessed, that she and the said Elizabeth Gooding, sent either of them an Jmpe to destroy the child of the said Mr. Edwards; this Examinants Jmpe being then a white one, and Elizabeth Goodings a black Jmpe; and that about thirty <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> since, this Examinant had the said white Jmpe, and two others, a gray, and a black Jmpe, of one Anne, the wife of Robert Pearce of <normalised orig="Stoak" auto="true">Stoic</normalised> in Suffolk, being her brother; and that these Jmpes went commingly from one two another, and did <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised> where ever they went; and that when this Examinant did not send and <normalised orig="imploy" auto="true">employ</normalised> them abroad to do <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised>, she had not her health, but when they were <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised> she was <normalised orig="healthfull" auto="true">healthful</normalised> and well, and that these Jmpes did usually suck those teats which were found about the private parts of her body; and that the said Jmpes did often speak to this Examinant, and told her, she should never <normalised orig="feele" auto="true">feel</normalised> hell torments, and that they spake to her in an hollow voyee, which she plainly understood: And this Examinant also <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, she sent her gray Jmpe to Elizabeth the daughter of Robert Kirk of Manytree,

about three <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> since, to destroy her; and upon the sending of the said Jmpe, the said Elizabeth lanhished by the space of one whole year, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> she dyed, and that the occasion of offence this Examinant took against her the said Elizabeth was, for that she had asked a <normalised orig="Coife" auto="true">Coif</normalised> of the said Elixabeth, which she refused to give to this Examinant. And further, this Examinant saith, that long since, but the exact time she cannot remember, she sent her gray Jmpe to kill the daughter of the widow Rawlyns of <normalised orig="Misley" auto="true">Mislay</normalised> aforesaid; and the reason was; because this Examinant was put out of her Farm, and the said widow Rawlyns put in, where she <normalised orig="dwelleth" auto="true">dwells</normalised> at this present. And moreover, this Examinant <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, that she was acquainted with the sending of an Jmpe by the aforesaid Elizabeth Gooding, to vex and torment Mary the wife of John <normalised orig="Tayler" auto="true">Tailor</normalised> of Mannyntree aforesaid about three <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised> since; and this Examinant being asked why she discover it to the said Mary, she said, the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> would not suffer her, and that the cause of the said Elizabeth Goodings malice against the said Mary was, because the said Mary refused to give the said Elizabeth some Beeregood. And lastly, this Examinant saith, that about eight weeks since this Examinant, the said Elizabeth Gooding, and one Anne West of Lawford widow, met together at the house of the said Elizabeth Clarke, where there was a <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> read, wherein she <normalised orig="thinkes" auto="true">thinks</normalised> there was no <normalised orig="goodnesse" auto="true">goodness</normalised>.
<normalised orig="VVHereas" auto="true">whereas</normalised> there was a <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> (of the Essex Witches) came forth in print, wherein on Mrs. <normalised orig="Wayt" auto="true">Wait</normalised> a Ministers wife was nominiated for one, but it was a palpable mistake, for it is very well <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> that she is a gentlewoman of a very godly and religious life, and a very good <normalised orig="conuersation" auto="true">conversation</normalised>: and this was set on purpose to vindicate her: and lay the fault on the Author, in whom it was a great mistake.
