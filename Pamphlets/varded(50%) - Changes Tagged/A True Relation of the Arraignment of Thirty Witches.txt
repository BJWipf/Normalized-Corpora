The Confession of Rebecca <normalised orig="VVest" auto="true">West</normalised>, daughter to Anne WEst of Colchester in Essex.

The said REbecca confessed at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>, that about Shrovetide last her mother bad her make haste of her <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>, for she must <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> along with her before <normalised orig="Sunne" auto="true">Sun</normalised> <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>: and as they were going over the fields, her mother gave her a great charge never to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> of wahat <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> or see, and she faithfully promised to keep <normalised orig="counsell" auto="true">counsel</normalised>. When she came ot the house of meeting there were five Witches more; the two <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised> were Mother Benefield and Mother Goodwin; this Mother Goodwin pulled out a <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised>, and after their manner they prayed out of it, and presently their <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> appeared in <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> shapes: six whereof appeared in the shapes of Kitnens about a <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> old in Mother Benefield's lap, and after she had kissed them, she said unto Rebecca that those were all her children which she had by as handsome a man as any was in England. Then they commanded their Spirits come to kill such a mans Horse, some a cow, some a Chi'de, etc. Then Mother Benefield called to mother West and asked if she were sure that her daugther REbecca would keep <normalised orig="counsell" auto="true">counsel</normalised>, or else tshe might <normalised orig="seeke" auto="true">seek</normalised> all their blood. She answered, Rebecca had promised. They all <normalised orig="replyed" auto="true">replied</normalised>, if she ever did spake of it that she should suffer more tortures and <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> on earth, then the <normalised orig="paiens" auto="true">paeans</normalised> of hell. Presently mother Benefield said, for more certainty let her take out Covenant and Oath as we have already done. Then they taught her waht to say, the <normalised orig="summe" auto="true">sum</normalised> where of was to deny God and her SAviour Iesus Crhist, to renounce all promises of his blessings, and the merits of his bitter death and passion, to <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> as they did, and to serve and obey as they did. And the said Rebecca confessed that so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as she had done thus, the <normalised orig="Divel" auto="true">Devil</normalised> in the shsape of a little <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> dog leaped into her lap, & kissed her three times, but she felt them very cold. Shortly after, when she was going to bed, the <normalised orig="Divel" auto="true">Devil</normalised> appeared unto her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> in the shape of a handsome <normalised orig="yung" auto="true">young</normalised> man, saying that he came ot marry her. The manner was thus: he took her by the hand, and leading her about the <normalised orig="roome" auto="true">room</normalised>, said, I take thee Rebecca to be my wife, and do promise to by they loving husband <normalised orig="til" auto="true">till</normalised> death, defending thee from all <normalised orig="harmes" auto="true">harms</normalised>; then he told her what <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> must say, hwereupon she took him by the hand and said, I Rebecca take thee to be my husband, and doe promise to be an obedient wife till death, faithfully to <normalised orig="performe" auto="true">perform</normalised> and observe all they commands; and the first whereof was that she should deny and renounce as aforesaid. And being asked by the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> whether she ever had <normalised orig="carnall" auto="true">carnal</normalised> copulation with the <normalised orig="Divel" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, she confessed that she had. And being asked divers questions by a Gentleman that did <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> several times with her before and <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterword</normalised> (giving her godly and comfortable instructions) she affirmed that so soon as one of the Witches was is prison, she was very desrious to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> all she knew, which accordingly she did, whereupon the rest were apprehended and sent unto the <normalised orig="Gaole" auto="true">Gaol</normalised>. She further affirmed, that when she was going to the Grand Inquest with one mother Miller (indicted for a Witch) she told mother Miller that she would <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> nothing, if the pulled her to pieces with pincers: and being asked the reason by the Gentleman, she said she found her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> in such extremeity of torture and amazement, that she would not endure it <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> for the world: and when she looked upon the ground <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> saw her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> encompssed in flames of fire: and presently the Grand Inquest called for her, where they admit but one at a time, and so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as she was thus separated from this mother Miller, the tortures and the flames <normalised orig="beganne" auto="true">began</normalised> to cease: whereupon she then confessed all <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> ever knew, and said that so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as her confession was fully ended, she found her conscience so tagiued and disburdened of all her torture, that she thought her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> the happiest creature in the world: <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised> affirming that the <normalised orig="Divel" auto="true">Devil</normalised> can take any shape, and speak <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> English.

Another witch sent her maid to a neighbours house for a <normalised orig="handfull" auto="true">handful</normalised> of <normalised orig="herbes" auto="true">herbs</normalised>, who meeting iwht her sweetheart staid an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> by the way, saying she should bee <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> hanged for staying so long: whereupon he told her that in such a place in their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> garden there grew the same <normalised orig="herbes" auto="true">herbs</normalised>, so it was but oging over the pale and her journey was ended; which she did, and pleased her <normalised orig="mistris" auto="true">mistress</normalised> well for her long stay, by bringing those <normalised orig="herbes" auto="true">herbs</normalised>. At night her <normalised orig="mistris" auto="true">mistress</normalised> bade her go up to bed first, which made her mistrust something; whereupon she peeked between the boards and observed her <normalised orig="mistris" auto="true">mistress</normalised> to cut the <normalised orig="herbes" auto="true">herbs</normalised> in small <normalised orig="peeces" auto="true">pieces</normalised>, strewing them about the room: the next morning her husband rising betimes found twelve or <normalised orig="fourteene" auto="true">fourteen</normalised> great Hogs, being all his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised>, dead in the yard, and so for his <normalised orig="Sheepe" auto="true">Sheep</normalised> all his other <normalised orig="Cattell" auto="true">Cattle</normalised>, and telling his wife how they were undone, she <normalised orig="replyed" auto="true">replied</normalised>, hath the <normalised orig="queane" auto="true">queen</normalised> served me thus? She shall suffer for it. Then he examined the maid, and both gave evidence. This was at Ipswich in <normalised orig="Suffolke" auto="true">Suffolk</normalised>.

The evidnece of Mr. Long a Minister <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> Cholchester in Essex.

First, that as he was riding on the way, the hsape of a red dog passed by him, at which his blood did rise; and being passed a small distance, turned his face, his eyes appearing nor like the eyes of any creature, his horse presently started, and never lefting kicking and flinging <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> he threw him <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, but had no hurt. An old woman in the <normalised orig="Towne" auto="true">Town</normalised> called goodwife Clarke being mistrusted and examined before Sir Thomas Boes, confessed that she sent forth this spirit, with command to make the horse throw Mr. Long and <normalised orig="breake" auto="true">break</normalised> his neck: and being demanded by Sir Thomas Boes what was the reason the Spirit did not <normalised orig="performe" auto="true">perform</normalised> her commands, she answered because the power of God was above the power of the <normalised orig="Divel" auto="true">Devil</normalised>. But the horse did pine to death for his punishment.

The evidence of said Mr. Long.

He said that one morning as he was walking abroad, a <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> woman being of his own Parish spake kindly to him, but his answer was that he <normalised orig="ahd" auto="true">and</normalised> a long time a good opinion of her, although he ever accounted her sister, an ill liver, and little better than those that are accounted Witches, but now he strongly <normalised orig="beleeved" auto="true">believed</normalised> that her sister had made her as bad as <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised>; this much trouble the old woman, and she would not leave following and <normalised orig="perswading" auto="true">persuading</normalised> the said mr. Long to bee of his former good opinion, professing her own innocence of any ill of such nature, or any coompact with such evil Spirit what soever, but finding him not satisfied with any thing she had said, she assured him she would give him an evidence <normalised orig="undenyable" auto="true">undeniable</normalised>, whereupon she lifted up both her hands toward heaven, calling God to witness, and desired that he would <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> a present <normalised orig="Iudgment" auto="true">Judgment</normalised> upon her if she were not onnocent and <normalised orig="cleare" auto="true">clear</normalised>: now Mr. Long affirmed upon his oath that these words were no sooner out of her mouth, but she was <normalised orig="strucke" auto="true">struck</normalised> to the ground upon her back before his face, where she did lye in a most lamentable condition, trembling and crying; he took her up and carried her into an Alehouse hard by, where she did lie in this <normalised orig="extremitie" auto="true">extremity</normalised> two <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, and that so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as she came ot <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised> he gave her the best comfort he could, <normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> how <normalised orig="mercifull" auto="true">merciful</normalised> God had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> to her in sparing her life, giving her time of repentance, the first step whereof must be her confession and contrition, whereupon she confessed that she had done much mischief, and that she had compacted with the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> usually sucked her and appeared unto her in the shape of a <normalised orig="Squirrell" auto="true">Squirrel</normalised>.

These aforesaid Witches have confessed that they did raise the great <normalised orig="windes" auto="true">winds</normalised> in March last, and caused a Hoy to be cast away, wherein were many passengers.

When these witches came ifrst into the <normalised orig="Goale" auto="true">Goal</normalised> at Colchester, the <normalised orig="Goaler" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> lost his meat often, and mistrusting that the Witches had got it, upon a time bought a good shoulder of Mutton, and said <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> to the dressing of it <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, but when it was ready the Witches had got it, and all the while the Witches were at supper with it, the <normalised orig="Goaler" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> instead of Mutton was eating Hogs-wash.

After this the <normalised orig="Gaoler" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> desrious to see more of their feats, <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> some of them to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> him a little of their cunning, thinking to make <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> merry for the <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> of his meat, whereupon one of the Witches bid him <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> fetch her <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> pewter dishes wherein never water came; straightway went the <normalised orig="Gaoler" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> to a Pewterer and got 4 new dishes, and <normalised orig="afore" auto="true">before</normalised> he brought them to the Witch he wet one of them, contrary to the Witches direction, nevertheless as <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as the Witch had them, she put her hands and feet into the <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> dishes, and upon an instant was lifted into the ayre with three dishes taht were dry, the fourth falling off, and by good chance was found in a meadow about <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> a mile off, and brought back to Prison.
