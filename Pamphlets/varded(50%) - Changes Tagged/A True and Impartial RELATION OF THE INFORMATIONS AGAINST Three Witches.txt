TO THE READER
Reader,
THis Relation was written by a faithful able Hand, employed in taking the examinations and Confessions of Temperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles, and <normalised orig="Susanna" auto="true">Suzanne</normalised> Edwards, who were Executed the 25th of August 1682. When I have told you, that it is the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> True, <normalised orig="Authentick" auto="true">Authentic</normalised>, and Exact Account; and that if any others creep abroad, they are lame and imperfect; I need no other Argument to recommend it to thy Perusal; <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> that it is the more remarkable, in regard we have had no Conviction or Execution of any Witches for many years past.

If thou dost not believe the being of Witches, study the Sacred Writ; consider that the Writ of Nations have provided Laws against such persons: Read those of King [a] Alfred, and the Canons Editus sub [b] Edgaro Rege. And that it hath been the Judgement of


this Kingdom, appears by an Act of Parliament which hath provided Punishments proportionable to the quality of this Offence.
Thou <normalised orig="mayst" auto="true">may</normalised> at leisure consult the Learned Monarch King James, in his Daemonologia, <normalised orig="fol" auto="true">foal</normalised>. 91. and the late <normalised orig="Tryal" auto="true">Trial</normalised> of Witches before the Honourable Judicious Great Man, Judge Hales. See also Dr. More's learned Discourse, <normalised orig="intituled" auto="true">entitled</normalised> Saducismus Triumphatus, where the Subject of Witches and Spirits is handled at large.

But this Informant and her said Husband seeing her in such a sad condition, did endeavour to take her up from the Ground, but could not, until that the said <normalised orig="Susanna" auto="true">Suzanne</normalised> was gone down over the Stairs.

THe said Informant upon her Oath saith, That upon or about the 2d day of February, which was in the year of our Lord 1680. this Informant was taken with great Pains in her Head and all her Limbs, which Pains continued on her till <normalised orig="neer" auto="true">near</normalised> or upon the first day of August then following; and then this Informants Pains began to abate, and this Informant was able to walk abroad to take the Air: But in the Night-season she was in much pain, and not able to take her rest.

This Informant further saith, That upon or about the 30th day of September now last past, this Informant was going up the High Street of Biddiford, where this



Informant met with Temperance Lloyd of Biddiford aforesaid Widow, and she the said Temperance did then and there fall down on her Knees to this Informant, and wept, (saying) Mrs. Grace, I am glad to see you so strong again.
Upon which this Informant said, Why dost thou weep for me? Unto which the said Temperance replied, I weep for Joy to see you so well again, as the said Temperance then pretended.

This Informant further saith, That in that very night she this Informant was taken very ill with sticking and pricking Pains, as though Pins and Awls had been thrust into her Body, from the Crown of her Head to the Soles of her Feet; and this Informant lay as though it had been upon a Rack.

And saith, That these pricking Pains have continued upon her Body ever since; and that her Pains are much worse by night than by day.

This Informant further saith, That on Thursday the first day of June last past in the night, she this Informant was bound and seemingly <normalised orig="chain'd" auto="true">chained</normalised> up, with all her sticking Pains gathered together in her Belly; so that on a sudden her Belly was <normalised orig="swoln" auto="true">swollen</normalised> as big as two Bellies, which caused her to cry out, I shall die, I shall die; and in this sad condition this Informant lay as though she had been dead for a long space (which those persons that were in the Chamber with her this Informant did compute to be about two hours).

And this Informant further saith, That on Fridaynight last, being the 30th day of June, this Informant was again <normalised orig="pinch'd" auto="true">pinched</normalised> and <normalised orig="prick'd" auto="true">pricked</normalised> to the Heart, with such cruel thrusting pains in her Head, Shoulders, Arms, Hands, Thighs, and Legs, as though the Flesh would have been
then immediately torn from the Bones with a mans Fingers and Thumbs.
And further saith, That she was even <normalised orig="pluck'd" auto="true">plucked</normalised> out over her Bed, and lay in this condition for the space of three hours (as she was informed by some of the said persons then in this Informants Chamber).

This Informant further saith, That upon the first day of this instant July, <normalised orig="assoon" auto="true">as soon</normalised> as the aforesaid Temperance Lloyd was apprehended and put in the Prison of Biddiford, she this Informant immediately felt her pricking and sticking pains to cease and abate.

And saith, That she hath continued so ever since unto this time; but is still in great weakness of Body.

And further saith, That she <normalised orig="believeth" auto="true">believes</normalised> that the said Temperance Lloyd hath been an Instrument of doing much hurt and harm unto her Body, by pricking and tormenting of her in manner as before in this her Information she hath set forth.

SHe the said Examinant did confess, that about the 14 day of March, which was in the year of our Lord 1670. she was Accused, Indicted, and Arraigned, for practising of Witchcraft upon the Body of one William Herbert, late of Biddiford aforesaid, Husbandman: And that although at the Trial of her life at the Castle of Exeter, she was there acquitted by the Judge and Jury then; yet this Examinant doth now confess, that she is guilty thereof, by the <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised> of the black Man; and that she did prick the said William Herbert unto death.

And although her Body was then searched by four Women of the Town of Biddiford aforesaid, and the Proofs then against her not so clear and conspicuous, the said Mr. Fellow did not further prosecute against her; yet this Examinant doth now confess that the said black Man or Devil, (or some other black Man or Devil) with her this said Examinantion did do some bodily hurt to the said Anne Fellow, and that thereupon the said Anne Fellow did shortly die and depart this life.

WHereas we, Thomas Eastchurch and Elizabeth Eastchurch his Wife, <normalised orig="Honor" auto="true">Honour</normalised> Hooper, and Anne Wakely, upon yesterday, which was the 3d of July, 1682. did give in and deliver our several <normalised orig="Informations" auto="true">Information</normalised> upon our Oaths, before Thomas Gist Mayor of the <normalised orig="Burrough" auto="true">Borough</normalised>, Town, and <normalised orig="Mannor" auto="true">Manor</normalised> of Biddiford aforesaid, and John <normalised orig="Davie" auto="true">Dave</normalised> Alderman, two of his Majesties Justices of the Peace within the same <normalised orig="Burrough" auto="true">Borough</normalised>, &c. of Biddiford, against Temperance Lloyd of Biddiford aforesaid Widow, for using and practising of Witchcraft upon the Body of Grace Thomas of the same Town Spinster, as by our several Examinations it doth and may appear.


But because we were dissatisfied in some particulars concerning a piece of Leather which the said Temperance had confessed of unto the said Elizabeth Eastchurch, in such manner as is mentioned in the said Elizabeth Eastchurch's Examination, and we conceiving that there might be some <normalised orig="inchantment" auto="true">enchantment</normalised> used in or about the said Leather: Therefore upon this present 4th day of July, we, with the leave and approbation of the said Mr. Gist the Mayor, did bring the said Temperance into the Parish-Church of Biddiford aforesaid, in the presence of Mr. Michael Ogilby Rector of the same Parish-Church, and divers other persons, where the said Temperance was demanded by the said Mr. Ogilby how long since the Devil did tempt her to do evil.
Whereupon she the said Temperance did say and confess, that about twelve years ago she was tempted by the Devil to be instrumental to the death of William Herbert named in her said Examination.

And that the Devil did promise her that she should live well and do well. And she did then also confess that she was thereupon an Instrument of the death of the said William Herbert.

And as to the said Grace Thomas, she further said and confessed, that on Friday was <normalised orig="Sevennight" auto="true">Seven-night</normalised>, (which was the 23th day of June last past) she the said Temperance came into the said Thomas Eastchurch's Shop in the form and shape of a Cat; And <normalised orig="fetcht" auto="true">fetched</normalised> out of the same Shop a Puppit or Picture, (commonly called a <normalised orig="Childs" auto="true">Child's</normalised> Baby) and that she carried the same up into the Chamber where the said Grace Thomas did lodge, and left it about the Bed whereon the said Grace Thomas did lie; but would not confess that she had <normalised orig="prickt" auto="true">pricked</normalised> any Pins in the said Puppit or Baby-picture, although she were demanded
particularly that Question by the said Mr. Ogilby.
Also the said Temperance did then and there confess, that she was the cause of the death of Anne Fellow, the Daughter of Edward Fellow named in her said Examination.

And <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, that this present day she this Examinant did prick and torment the said Grace Barnes again, (intimating with her Fingers how she did it). And also <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, that the Devil did <normalised orig="intice" auto="true">entice</normalised> her to make an end of her the said Grace Barnes; and that he told her that he would come again to her once more before she should go out of Town.

Examined with the Original, whereof this is a true Copy.

John Hill Town-Clerk.

The Substance of the Last words and Confessions of <normalised orig="Susanna" auto="true">Suzanne</normalised> Edwards, Temperance Lloyd, and Mary Trembles, at the time and place of their Execution; as fully as could be taken in a Case liable to so much noise and confusion, as is usual on such Occasions.
Mr. H.
MAry Trembles, What have you to say as to the Crime you are now to die for?

Mary.
I have spoke as much as I can speak already, and can speak no more.

H.
In what shape did the Devil come to you?

Mary.
The Devil came to me once, I think, like a Lyon.

H.
Did he offer any violence to you?

Mary.
No, not at all, but did frighten me, and did nothing to me. And I cried to God, and asked what he would have, and he vanished.

H.
Did he give thee any Gift, or <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> thou make him any Promise?

Mary.
No.

H.
Had he any of thy <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>?

Mary.
No.

H.
Did he come to make use of thy Body in a carnal manner?

Mary.
Never in my life.

H.
Have you a Teat in your Privy-parts?

Mary.
None. The Grand Inquest said it was sworn to them.

H.
Mary Trembles, Was not the Devil there with Susan when I was once in the Prison with you, and under her Coats? the other told me that he was there, but is now fled; and that the Devil was in the way when I was going to Taunton with my Son who is a Minister. Thou <normalised orig="speakest" auto="true">speak</normalised> now as a dying Woman, and as the Psalmist says, I will confess my iniquities and acknowledge all my sin. We find that Mary Magdalen had seven Devils, and she came to Christ and obtained Mercy: And if thou break thy League with the Devil, and make a Covenant with God, thou <normalised orig="mayst" auto="true">may</normalised> also obtain Mercy. If thou hast any thing to speak, speak thy mind.

Mary.
I have spoke the very truth, and can speak no more:

Mr. H.
I would desire they may come by me, and Confess as I have done.

H.
Temperance Lloyd, Have you made any Contract with the Devil?

Temp.
No.

H.
Did he ever take any of thy <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>?

Temp.
No.

H.
How did he appear to thee first, or where in the street? in what shape?

Temp.
In a <normalised orig="woful" auto="true">woeful</normalised> shape.

H.
Had he ever any carnal knowledge of thee?

Temp.
No, never.

H.
What did he do when he came to thee?

Temp.
He caused me to go and do harm.

H.
And did you go?

Temp.
I did hurt a Woman sore against my Conscience: he carried me up to her door, which was open: The <normalised orig="Womans" auto="true">Women's</normalised> name was Mrs. Grace Thomas.

H.
What caused you to do her harm? what malice had you against her? did she do you any harm?

Temp.
No, she never did me any harm: but the Devil beat me about the Head grievously because I would not kill her: but I did bruise her after this fashion

laying her two Hands to her Sides.
H.
Did you bruise her till the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> came out of her Mouth and Nose?

Temp.
No.


H.
How many did you destroy and hurt?

Temp.
None but she.

H.
Did you know any <normalised orig="Marriners" auto="true">Mariners</normalised> that you or your Associates destroyed by overturning of Ships and Boats?

Temp.
No; I never hurt any Ship, Bark, or Boat in my life.

H.
Was it you or Susan that did bewitch the Children?

Temp.
I sold Apples, and the Child took an Apple from me, and the Mother took the Apple from the Child; for the which I was very angry: but the Child died of the Small Pox.

H.
Do you know one Mr. Lutteril about these parts, or any of your Confederates? did you or them bewitch his Child?

Temp.
No.

H.
Temperance, How did you come in to hurt Mrs. Grace Thomas? did you pass through the Key-hole of the Door, or was the Door open?

Temp.
The Devil did lead me up Stairs, and the Door was open: and this is all the hurt I did.

H.
How do you know it was the Devil?

Temp.
I knew it by his Eyes?

H.
Had you no Discourse or Treaty with him?

Temp.
No; he said I should go along with him to destroy a woman, and I told him I would not: he said he would make me; and then the Devil beat me about the Head.

H.
Why had you not called upon God?

Temp.
He would not let me do it.

H.
You say you never <normalised orig="hurted" auto="true">hurt</normalised> Ships nor Boats; did you never ride over an Arm of the Sea on a Cow?

Temp.
No, no, Master, <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> she, meaning Susan.

When Temperance said <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> Susan, she said she lied, and that she was the cause of her bringing to die: for she said when she was first brought to Goal, if that she was hanged, she would have me hanged too; she reported I should ride on a Cow before her, which I never did.

H.
Susan, Did you see the shape of a Bullock? at the first time of your Examination you said it was like a short black man, about the length of you Arm.

<normalised orig="Sus" auto="true">Suss</normalised>.
He was black, Sir.

H.
Susan, Had you any knowledge of the bewitching of Mr. Lutteril's Child, or did you know a place called Tranton Burroughs?

<normalised orig="Sus" auto="true">Suss</normalised>.
No.

H.
Are you willing to have any Prayers?

Then Mr. H. prayed, whose Prayer we could not take; and they sung part of the 40 Psalm, at the desire of <normalised orig="Susanna" auto="true">Suzanne</normalised> Edwards: As

she mounted the Ladder, she said, The Lord Jesus speed me; though my sins be as red as Scarlet, the Lord Jesus can make them as white as Snow: The Lord help my Soul. Then was executed.
Mary Trembles said, Lord Jesus receive my Soul; Lord Jesus speed me; and then was also executed.

Temperance Lloyd said, Jesus Christ speed me well: Lord forgive all my sins; Lord Jesus Christ be merciful to my poor Soul.

Mr. Sheriff.
You are <normalised orig="lookt" auto="true">looked</normalised> on as the woman that has <normalised orig="debaucht" auto="true">debauched</normalised> the other two: Did you ever lie with Devils?

Temp.
No.

Sh.
Did not you know of their coming to Goal?

Temp.
No.

Sh.
Have you any thing to say to <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> the world?

Temp.
I forgive them, as I desire the Lord Jesus Christ will forgive me. The greatest thing I did was to Mrs. Grace Thomas; and I desire I may be sensible of it, and that the Lord Jesus Christ may forgive me. The Devil met me in the street, and bid me kill her; and because I would not, he beat me about the head and back.

Mr. Sh.
In what Shape or Colour was he?

Temp.
In black, like a Bullock.

Sh.
How do you know you did it? how went you in, through the Key-hole, or the Door?

Temp.
At the Door.

Sh.
Had you no discourse with the Devil?

Temp.
Never but this day six weeks.

Sh.
You were charged about 12 years since, and did you never see the Devil but this time?

Temp.
Yes, once before: I was going for Brooms, and he came to me and said, This poor woman has a great <normalised orig="burthen" auto="true">burden</normalised>; and would help ease me of my <normalised orig="Burthen" auto="true">Burden</normalised>: and I said, The Lord had enabled me to carry it so far, and I hope I shall be able to carry it further.

Sh.
Did the Devil never promise you any thing?

Temp.
No, never.

Sh.
Then you have served a very bad Master, who gave you nothing. Well; consider you are just departing this world: do you believe there is a God?

Temp.
Yes.

Sh.
Do you believe in Jesus Christ?

Temp.
Yes; and I pray Jesus Christ to pardon all my sins.

And so was Executed.
    FINIS.
