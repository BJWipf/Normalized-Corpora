THE PREFACE.
INGENUOUS READER;
THou hast here presented to thee a sad Emblem of the strange sleights and cunning <normalised orig="subtilties" auto="true">subtleties</normalised>, whereby Satan la∣bours daily to <normalised orig="insnare" auto="true">ensnare</normalised> <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised>, and at last to bring them to utter <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised>; who being that grand impostor, <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> began this <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>, even in the morning of the Creation, in the body of a Serpent miraculously, to reason, dispute, <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, and <normalised orig="conferre" auto="true">confer</normalised> with <normalised orig="Evah" auto="true">Eve</normalised>; and never ceased till he had laid the honour of those glorious creatures in the dust: and therefore is called that old Serpent, that <normalised orig="decei" auto="true">decay</normalised>∣veth all the world, by whose <normalised orig="deceitfull" auto="true">deceitful</normalised> promises and <normalised orig="subtill" auto="true">subtle</normalised> devices (for his own end, and desire of their destruction,) hath <normalised orig="insnared" auto="true">ensnared</normalised> and <normalised orig="drawne" auto="true">drawn</normalised> these <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> silly creatures, into these horrid and detestable practises, of renouncing God and Christ, and <normalised orig="entring" auto="true">entering</normalised> into a <normalised orig="solemne" auto="true">solemn</normalised> league and contract with the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> [a]; the thought whereof is sufficient to cause a man to be filled with horror and astonishment. The Law and ex∣<normalised orig="presse" auto="true">press</normalised> command of God doth allow of no familiarity or in∣quiry of any other spirit, but from <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>; as Isa. 8.19. And when they shall say unto you, <normalised orig="seeke" auto="true">seek</normalised> unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto Wizards, that peep and that mutter, should not a people <normalised orig="seeke" auto="true">seek</normalised> unto their God, &c. <normalised orig="Vnder" auto="true">Under</normalised> this interrogative is understood this af∣firmative,

A people should inquire of no other spirit, but of their God <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>. By which also it is evident, that all spirits that doe suffer themselves to be inquired at, are <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> spirits, and therefore [b] <normalised orig="Devills" auto="true">Devils</normalised>. And though these <normalised orig="devillish" auto="true">devilish</normalised> pra∣ctises were frequent and common amongst heathens and in∣fidells, who usually held familiarity with these spirits, and many inquired of them in their Oracles; and therefore cal∣led those spirits that gave answer by them, Daemons [c] of their skill and knowledge in <normalised orig="soretelling" auto="true">foretelling</normalised> things to come: yet now when the light of the Gospel <normalised orig="shineth" auto="true">shines</normalised> so gloriously, that such a generation of <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> deluded <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised> (and to such a <normalised orig="num" auto="true">number</normalised>∣ber as hath of late been discovered) should be found amongst us, is much more matter of admiration and astonishment [d]. I doubt not but these things may <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> as incredible unto some, as they are matter of admiration unto others. Nolle nimis sapere, saith the Poet, It is true <normalised orig="wisdome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised> not to be too wise; that is, not to know nor desire to know more then is al∣lowed or <normalised orig="needfull" auto="true">needful</normalised>; <normalised orig="needfull" auto="true">needful</normalised> not in our desires, but in Gods decree: Here then let reasonable men be <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> not too much (as is <normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised>) to swell with indignation, or to be puf∣fed with impatience, where God doth not <normalised orig="apertly" auto="true">overtly</normalised> <normalised orig="reveale" auto="true">reveal</normalised> and plainly (as they desire and <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> <normalised orig="needfull" auto="true">needful</normalised>) the <normalised orig="subtile" auto="true">subtle</normalised> Engines and <normalised orig="mysticall" auto="true">mystical</normalised> craft of the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> in the <normalised orig="machina" auto="true">machine</normalised>∣tions of Witches and Sorcerers; but soberly, modestly, and discreetly, so far forth-be contented to pursue the <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> and just way of their <normalised orig="discoverie" auto="true">discovery</normalised>, as with sense, with reason, with Religion, is just and righteous; knowing, that what∣soever is beyond these lists, is <normalised orig="reasonlesse" auto="true">reasonless</normalised>, <normalised orig="senslesse" auto="true">senseless</normalised> and <normalised orig="impi" auto="true">imp</normalised>∣<normalised orig="ous" auto="true">os</normalised>. The greatest doubt and question will be, whether it be in the power of the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> to perform such asportation and <normalised orig="locall" auto="true">local</normalised> translation of the bodies of Witches; it <normalised orig="seemeth" auto="true">seems</normalised> in reason a thing whereunto the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> is unable: And <normalised orig="whe" auto="true">when</normalised>∣<normalised orig="ther" auto="true">there</normalised> these <normalised orig="supernaturall" auto="true">supernatural</normalised> works, which are above the power of


man to do, and proper only to Spirits, whether they are <normalised orig="reall" auto="true">real</normalised>, or only imaginary and fained. In answer to which, it is ve∣<normalised orig="ry" auto="true">rye</normalised> probable that the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> hath power to dispose and <normalised orig="trans" auto="true">trance</normalised>∣port the bodies of men and women, where God himself doth not countermand or prohibit: as instance, when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> took the body of our Saviour and set it upon a <normalised orig="pinacle" auto="true">pinnacle</normalised> of the Temple; and these <normalised orig="supernaturall" auto="true">supernatural</normalised> acts may appear to the outward sense, as Histories; and many other true reports and Records of other <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> works and <normalised orig="supernaturall" auto="true">supernatural</normalised> feats, all alike of∣<normalised orig="fered" auto="true">feared</normalised> to the outward sense. It is true, that a Spirit, and a <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> work simply in it self, in the own nature and substance cannot be seen by any bodily eye, or be deprehended by any outward sense, notwithstanding, as they do mix them∣selves with bodily substances, are certainly tried and subject to the sense: For illustration hereof, instance may be given in holy Scripture, as the Sorcerers of Egypt, where water was turned into blood, the rod into a Serpent, &c. By a <normalised orig="spi" auto="true">spy</normalised>∣<normalised orig="rituall" auto="true">ritual</normalised> power their eyes did manisestly see the water, and as apparently after see the blood, and the rod turned into a Serpent, the eye being a true and undeceived <normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> of both: Things imagined and fancied, are easily discerned from those things that are <normalised orig="reall" auto="true">real</normalised> and true objects. But it may be demanded, whether a Spirit or <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> can cause such a transmutation of the bodies of Witches into those <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> shapes and forms of Cats, <normalised orig="Dogges" auto="true">Dogs</normalised>, Birds, and other creatures, as is often reported, where Witches and Sorcerers have lived. The answer is, that it is <normalised orig="impos" auto="true">impose</normalised>∣sible in nature, and in the ordinary unchangeable course of all things created by God, that one <normalised orig="individuall" auto="true">individual</normalised> and conti∣nued substance or entire thing should be wholly divided from it self, and yet be it self; [e] for there can be no <normalised orig="reall" auto="true">real</normalised> or true transmutation of one substance, or nature into another, but either by creation or generation. Now creation is the


<normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> of in infinite power, and therefore of God alone. The <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> then cannot create, neither can he do it by any course of true generation, [f] because a true and <normalised orig="reall" auto="true">real</normalised> generation hath many precedent alterations, and by little and little, in space of time [g] <normalised orig="growes" auto="true">grows</normalised> unto the perjection of that kind unto which it doth tend, or is begotten; therefore they are but seeming and <normalised orig="jugling" auto="true">juggling</normalised> transmutations of the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised>: And here that saying of Augustine may be <normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised>, De civit. Dei, lib. 18. cap. 18. (Nec sane Daemones natu∣ras creant, sed specie tenus, quae à Deo creata sunt commutant, ut videantur esse quae non sunt) that is, Devils cannot create any nature or substance, but in jug∣gling <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised>, or seemingly only, whereby with false <normalised orig="shadowes" auto="true">shadows</normalised> covering those things which are created of God to cause them to seem that which they are not indeed. Take one in∣stance of the <normalised orig="jugglings" auto="true">juggling</normalised> and illusions <normalised orig="ef" auto="true">of</normalised> the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> above all the rest, which doth most palpably detect him herein, is a History related by Johannes <normalised orig="Baptista" auto="true">Baptist</normalised> <normalised orig="Porta" auto="true">Port</normalised>, in his se∣cond book, de Magia <normalised orig="naturali" auto="true">natural</normalised>; <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> there <normalised orig="witnesseth" auto="true">witnesses</normalised>, that upon the Devils suggestion, a Witch believed firmly and <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> her self, that all the night <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had rid in the <normalised orig="aire" auto="true">air</normalised>, over divers great <normalised orig="mountaines" auto="true">mountains</normalised>, and met in <normalised orig="conven" auto="true">convene</normalised>∣ticles with other Witches, when the same night, the men∣tioned Author himself, with others that watched her and saw her all that imagined time of her transvection in the <normalised orig="aire" auto="true">air</normalised>, to be within her chamber profoundly sleeping; yea, had smitten her, made her flesh blew with strokes, and could not awake her, nor <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> her <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterword</normalised> when she was awa∣ked that they had so used her, or at all had <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> or be∣held her; thus prevalent was the juggling power of the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised>.
Many other like instances of like nature might be added, only what here is published and communicated unto the

world, may sufficiently discover those strong delusions which these poor <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised> were given up unto, who now according to their demerits, and according to the <normalised orig="Lawes" auto="true">Laws</normalised> of God and this <normalised orig="kingdome" auto="true">kingdom</normalised> established, have received their just reward.

And Sir Thomas <normalised orig="Bowes" auto="true">Bows</normalised>, Knight, another of his Majesties Justices of Peace for this County, the 21th of March. 1645.
THis Informant saith, That about Christmas last, his wife was taken <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised>, and lame, with such violent fits, that this Informant verily conceived her <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> was some∣thing more then <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised> <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised>: Where∣upon this Informant about a fortnight since went to a Cunning Woman, the wife of one Hovye at Hadleigh in <normalised orig="Suffolke" auto="true">Suffolk</normalised>, who told this Informant, that his wife was cursed by two women who were <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> neighbours to this Informant, the one dwelling a little above his house, and the other beneath his house, this Informants house standing on the side of an Hill: Whereupon he <normalised orig="beleeved" auto="true">believed</normalised> his said wife was bewitched by one Elizabeth Clarke, alias Bedingfield, that dwelt above this Informants house, for that the said Eliza∣beths mother and some other of her <normalised orig="kinsfolke" auto="true">kinsfolk</normalised> did suffer death for Witchcraft and <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised>.


The Information of Matthew Honkins, of Mannintree, Gent. taken upon Oath before us the 25th day of March. 1645.
THis Informant saith, That the said Elizabeth Clarke (suspected for a Witch as aforesaid) being by the appointment of the said Justices watched <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> nights, for the better discovery of her wicked Practises, this Informant came into the <normalised orig="roome" auto="true">room</normalised> where the said Elizabeth was watched; as aforesaid, the last night, being the 24th of this instant March, but intended not to have stayed long there. But the said Elizabeth forth with told this Informant and one Master Sterne there present, if they would stay and do the said Elizabeth no hurt, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would call one of her white <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised>, and play with it in her lap; but this Informant told her, they would not allow of it; And that staying there a while longer, the said Elizabeth confessed <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had had <normalised orig="carnall" auto="true">carnal</normalised> copulation with the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> six or seven <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>; and that he would <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> to her three or <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> times in a <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> at her bed side, and <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to bed to her, and lye with her <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> a night together in the shape of a proper Gen∣tleman, with a laced band, having the whole proportion of a man, and would say to her, <normalised orig="Besse" auto="true">Bess</normalised> Imust lye with you, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did never deny him: And within a quarter of an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> after there appeared an <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised> like to a Dog, which was white, with some sandy spots, and seemed to be very fat and <normalised orig="plumpe" auto="true">plump</normalised>; with very short <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised>, who forthwith vanished away: And the said Elizabeth said the name of that <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised> was, Jarmara: And immediately there appeared ano∣<normalised orig="ther" auto="true">there</normalised> <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised>, which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> called Vinegar Tom, in the shape of a Grey∣hound with long <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised>: And the said Elizabeth then said that the next <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised> should be a black <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised>, and should come for the said Master Sterne, which appeared, but presently vanished: And the last that appeared was in the shape of a <normalised orig="Polcat" auto="true">Polecat</normalised>, but the head some∣what bigger. And the said Elizabeth then told this Informant that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had five <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> of her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised>, and two of the <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> of the old Beldam <normalised orig="Weste" auto="true">West</normalised> (meaning one Anne <normalised orig="Weste" auto="true">West</normalised>, widow) who is now al∣so suspected to be guilty of Witchcraft: And said sometimes the <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> of the old Beldam sucked on the said Elizabeth, and some∣times her <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> sucked on the old Beldam <normalised orig="Weste" auto="true">West</normalised>. And the said Elizabeth further told this Informant, that Satan would never let

her rest, or be quiet, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did consent to the killing of the <normalised orig="Hogges" auto="true">Hogs</normalised> of one Mr Edwards of Mannintree aforesaid, and the Horse of one Robert <normalised orig="Tayler" auto="true">Tailor</normalised> of the same <normalised orig="Towne" auto="true">Town</normalised>: And this Informant fur∣<normalised orig="ther" auto="true">there</normalised> saith, That going from the House of the said Mr Edwards to his own House about nine or ten of the Clock that night, with his Greyhound with him, he saw the Greyhound suddenly give a <normalised orig="jumpe" auto="true">jump</normalised>, and ran as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had been in a full course after an Hare; And that when this Informant made haste to see what his Grey∣hound so eagerly pursued; He espied a white thing about the big∣<normalised orig="nesse" auto="true">ness</normalised> of a Kitlyn, and the Greyhound standing aloose from it; and that by and by the said white <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised> or Kitlyn <normalised orig="daunced" auto="true">danced</normalised> about the said Greyhound, and by all likelihood bit off a piece of the flesh of the shoulder of the Greyhound; for the Greyhound came shrieking and crying to this Informant with a piece of flesh <normalised orig="torne" auto="true">torn</normalised> from her shoulder. And this Informant further saith, That com∣ming into his own Yard that night, he espied a black thing, pro∣portioned like a Cat, <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> it was thrice as big, sitting on a straw∣berry-bed, and fixing the eyes on this Informant; and when he went towards it, it leaped over the pale towards this Informant, as he thought, but ran quite through the Yard, with his Grey∣hound after it to a great Gate, which was underset with a <normalised orig="paire" auto="true">pair</normalised> of <normalised orig="Tumbrell" auto="true">Tumbrel</normalised> Strings, and did throw the said Gate wide open, and then vanished; And the said Greyhound returned <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to this Informant, shaking and trembling exceedingly.

The Information of John Sterne, Gent. taken upon Oath before us the 25th day of March. 1645.
THis Informant saith, That watching with Elizabeth Clarke, (suspected for Witchcraft, as aforesaid) <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> confessed that the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> had had <normalised orig="carnall" auto="true">carnal</normalised> copulation with her in the <normalised orig="likenesse" auto="true">likeness</normalised> of a man; and that the said Elizabeth desired this Informant, and the rest that were in the <normalised orig="roome" auto="true">room</normalised> with her to sit <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, and said, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> this Informant and the rest some of her <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised>: And within <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> there appeared a white thing in the likeness of a Cat, but not altogether so big: And being asked if she would not be afraid of her <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised>; the said Elizabeth answered; What

doe <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> I am afraid of my children? And that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> called the name of that white <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised>, Hoult. And this Informant further saith, That presently after there appeared another white <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised>, with red spots, as big as a small dog, which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> then called Jarmara: And that immediately after, there appeared at the threshold of the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> another <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised> about the <normalised orig="bignesse" auto="true">bigness</normalised> of the first, but did present∣<normalised orig="ly" auto="true">lie</normalised> vanish away. And then the said Elizabeth being asked if any more <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> would come; <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> answered, That Vinegar Tom would come by and by. And forthwith there appeared another in the like∣<normalised orig="nesse" auto="true">ness</normalised> of a dumb <normalised orig="Dogge" auto="true">Dog</normalised>, somewhat bigger then any of the former: And the said Elizabeth also told this Informant, That <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had three <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> from her mother, which were of a browne colour, and two from the old Beldam <normalised orig="Weste" auto="true">West</normalised>: And that there had five <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> appeared; But <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had one more called Sack and Sugar, which had been hard at <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>, and it would be long before it came, but it should <normalised orig="teare" auto="true">tear</normalised> this Informant. And a while after the said Elizabeth said, That it was well for this Informant he was so quick, otherwise the said <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised> had <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> skipped upon his face, and perchance had got into his <normalised orig="throate" auto="true">throat</normalised>, and then there would have been a feast of <normalised orig="Toades" auto="true">Toads</normalised> in this Informants belly. And the said Elizabeth further confessed to this Informant, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had one <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised> for which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would fight up to the knees in <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>, before <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would lose it. And that her <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> did commonly suck on the old Beldam <normalised orig="Weste" auto="true">West</normalised>; and that the said old Beldams <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised>, did suck on her the said Elizabeth likewise.

this Examinant had the said white Imp, and two others, a gray, and a black Imp of one Anne, the wife of Robert Pearce of <normalised orig="Stoak" auto="true">Stoic</normalised> in Suffolk, being her brother; and that these Imps went com∣monly from one to another, and did mischief where ever they went; and that when this Examinant did not send and <normalised orig="imploy" auto="true">employ</normalised> them abroad to do mischief, she had not her health, but when they were <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised>, she was <normalised orig="healthfull" auto="true">healthful</normalised> and well, and that these Imps did usually suck those teats which were found about the pri∣vie parts of her body; and that the said Imps did often speak to this Examinant, and told her, she should never <normalised orig="feele" auto="true">feel</normalised> hell torments, and that they spake to her in an hollow <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised>, which she plainly understood: And this Examinant also <normalised orig="confes" auto="true">confess</normalised>∣seth, that she sent her gray Imp to Elizabeth, the daughter of <normalised orig="Ro" auto="true">To</normalised>∣bert Kirk of Mannyntree, about three <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised> since, to destroy her; and upon the sending of the said Imp, the said Elizabeth languish∣ed by the space of one whole <normalised orig="yeer" auto="true">year</normalised>, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> dyed, and that the occasion of offence this Examinant took against her the said Eli∣zabeth was, for that she had asked a <normalised orig="Coife" auto="true">Coif</normalised> of the said Elizabeth, which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> refused to give to this Examinant. And further, this Examinant saith, that long since, but the exact time she cannot remember, she sent her gray Imp to kill the daughter of the widow Rawlyns of <normalised orig="Misley" auto="true">Mislay</normalised> aforesaid; and the reason was, because this Ex∣<normalised orig="aminant" auto="true">eminent</normalised> was put out of her Farm, and the said widow Rawlyns put in, where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="dwelleth" auto="true">dwells</normalised> at this present.

at last caught one of them in his hand, and holding it by the body, of it, he beat the head of it against his stick, intending to beat out the <normalised orig="braines" auto="true">brains</normalised> of it; but when he could not kill it that way, he <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> the body of it in one hand, and the head of it in another, and in∣<normalised orig="deavoured" auto="true">devoured</normalised> to wring off the head; and as he wrung and stretched the neck of it, it came out between his hands like a lock of <normalised orig="wooll" auto="true">wool</normalised>; yet he would not give over his intended purpose, but knowing of a Spring not <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> off, he went to <normalised orig="drowne" auto="true">drown</normalised> it; but still as he went he fell <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, and could not <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> but <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> he fell <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, so that he at last crept upon his hands and knees till he came at the water, and holding it fast in his hand, he put his hand <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> into the water up to his elbow, and held it under water a good, space, till he conceived it was drowned, and then letting <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> his hand, it sprung out of the water up into the <normalised orig="aire" auto="true">air</normalised>, and so vanished away: and then <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> to the said Anne Wests <normalised orig="dore" auto="true">door</normalised>, he saw her standing there in her smock, and asked her why <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did set her <normalised orig="Impes" auto="true">Imps</normalised> to molest and trouble him? to whom <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> made an∣swer, that they were not sent to trouble him, but were sent out as Scouts upon another <normalised orig="designe" auto="true">design</normalised>.
