The next was a remarkable <normalised orig="Tryal" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, and much to be reagrded in this Age of Sadducism, wherein so many, as apreparative to Atheism, deny the existence of Evil Spirits, or at least their Confederacies and Contracts with mortals. a Woman being indicted for Witchcraft, the fact laid to her charge was, that she had bewitched a young maiden that had given her some small affront. And to make this presence good, there was produced a piont of Blood pull of Nails and crooked Pins <normalised orig="bow'd" auto="true">bowed</normalised> into strange forms; all which the Witnesses attested the Maid had cast up by a Vomit: Some <normalised orig="threatning" auto="true">threatening</normalised> words of the Prisoners were also <normalised orig="alleadged" auto="true">alleged</normalised>, and the Outcries of the person afflicted, calling upon her in the height of her fits, and <normalised orig="extraodinary" auto="true">extraordinary</normalised> Ravings when she was brought into her pretence. Another woman said, she verily believed she had <normalised orig="bewitcht" auto="true">bewitched</normalised> no less than three of her Husbands; the first it seems died strangely; the second going out, the now Prisoner said he should be <normalised orig="drownd" auto="true">drowned</normalised> and never come home again, which <normalised orig="happen'd" auto="true">happened</normalised> accordingly; and the third <normalised orig="strucken" auto="true">stricken</normalised> suddenly, has for some time even to this day, lost most part of his understanding and senses. All this and some other things of like kind were suggested, but <normalised orig="seem'd" auto="true">seemed</normalised> rather to be <normalised orig="bottom'd" auto="true">bottomed</normalised> on Conceit than judgment or certain knowledge; and the Crime being in its nature so abstruse, difficiult, and apt to be mistaken, on which neither Philosophers nor Divines are yet sufficiently agreed, at least as to the manner of their Operations, <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> thought fit to continue her in Jail till a further scrtuiny of the matter might be made, before she should be acquitted from the charge, or condemned for so black a Crime.
