To Sir T. M.
SIR,
ACcording to your Request, I send you <normalised orig="Inclos'd" auto="true">Enclosed</normalised> the Proceedings of the Commissioners appointed by the Lords of His Majestys most Honourable Privy <normalised orig="Councill" auto="true">Council</normalised>, for enquiring into the Witches and Witchcrafts in the Shiriffdome of Renfrew, of which I have had Opportunity of knowing more than many others, as having been with the Commissioners on the <normalised orig="Tryalls" auto="true">Trials</normalised>; And shall add nothing here, save what passed at the first <normalised orig="Dyet" auto="true">Diet</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, which was at Paislaw, where were Met of the Commissioners, my Lord Blantyre, my Lord Halcraig, Sir Iohn Maxwell of Polock, Mr. Francis Montgomery, Blackhall, Duchall, with several others, to the Number of Eleven. There was Deputed in the room of the King's Advocate, Three Advocates, viz. Mr. John Menzies, Mr. Grant and Mr. Stuart. The <normalised orig="Panalls" auto="true">Panels</normalised> being 21 in number, were frequently <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> to see if they could be brought to Confession; They were Confronted with Bargarens Daughter, and the three little Confessors, Elizabeth Anderson, and the two Lindsays. But they still <normalised orig="deny'd" auto="true">denied</normalised> all: which put the Court to Cull out 7 of them, against whom <normalised orig="Threatnings" auto="true">Threatenings</normalised>, and some Malifice following could be proven. These were Margaret Lang, in Cartinpan, a Woman Famous for Religion, ever since the 60 year of God, and really a Person of extraordinary Gravity and Wisdom; I know not whether to call it Natural or Diabolical; but I have never heard a Woman speak so Gravely, Pertinently, and Religiously both to the Ministers and Judges then she did. The other were <normalised orig="Katharine" auto="true">Katherine</normalised> Campbell, Agnes Nasmith, John and James Lindsays, Agnes Fostur, and Margaret Fulton: This Kate Cambell is a young Well-favour'd Lass, 20 years of Age; but the rest most part Old, both Men and Women.

The Commissioners, after their first Assay to have them confess, before they brought them to a Formal <normalised orig="Tryal" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, would have them <normalised orig="Try'd" auto="true">Tried</normalised> by Pricking, which really to me seems strange, for there was not any of them, save Margaret Fulton, but Marks were found on them, which were altogether <normalised orig="Incensible" auto="true">Insensible</normalised>, That a Needle of 3 Inches length was frequently put in without their Knowledge, nor would any blood come from these places, and tho many, especially Doctors, <normalised orig="ridicul'd" auto="true">ridiculed</normalised> these as <normalised orig="Storys" auto="true">Stories</normalised>, yet after we <normalised orig="cal'd" auto="true">called</normalised> Dr. Bisbin and Baird, and let them see a Needle

of a great length put into the top of one of the Vertibrae of the Back, and one into Margaret Lang, a handbreadth beneath her <normalised orig="Ribbs" auto="true">Ribs</normalised> in the Region of the Lower Belly, they both thought it wonderful, being in a place where, in another Woman, the Needle could not but <normalised orig="peirce" auto="true">pierce</normalised> the <normalised orig="Gutts" auto="true">Guts</normalised>: All the other 14 were also <normalised orig="prickt" auto="true">pricked</normalised> and marks found in most of them. But I was most <normalised orig="concern'd" auto="true">concerned</normalised> for Martha Semple Daughter to Margaret Lang, who was most exactly <normalised orig="search'd" auto="true">searched</normalised> twice, yet no mark found; tho the pricker mist not to search the very Soles of her Feet and other more Secret Places, for when there was any difficulty to find the mark they did quite uncloath them, but then it was in a Room, and not <normalised orig="publickly" auto="true">publicly</normalised>, before one or two of the Justices, a Minister, one of the Advocatrs, and the Clark, my Lord Halcraig and I were only present with Martha; but <normalised orig="realy" auto="true">really</normalised> she is as well <normalised orig="Favourd" auto="true">Favoured</normalised> and Gentile a Lass as <normalised orig="you'l" auto="true">you'll</normalised> look on, and about 17 or 18 years of Age, I took up Mr. <normalised orig="Wylie" auto="true">Wily</normalised> to her to see if he could bring her to any Confession, he spoke long to her but she <normalised orig="deny'd" auto="true">denied</normalised> all notwithstanding of what you see in the Encloased paper, but she was the only person amongst them all that ever I saw Weep.
They were at last on the 15th. of April to have been brought to their <normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, after 3 or 4 days <normalised orig="triflling" auto="true">trifling</normalised> with them by pricking, and to bring some of them to Confession, but just as the Assize was constitute they <normalised orig="mov'd" auto="true">moved</normalised> to have a little more time to provide themselves Advocates, which the Justices <normalised orig="yeilded" auto="true">yielded</normalised> to, and <normalised orig="adjourn'd" auto="true">adjourned</normalised> to the 2d. Tuesday of May, and in this Interval the two Brothers did Confess, and upon Examination said the same things that the two Lindsays and Anderson had declared, as you have it in the within Paper. Another Man also <normalised orig="confes'd" auto="true">confessed</normalised>, But the Devil Strangled him in Prison, for he was found fitting in a Chair with a Cord about his Neck but slack and <normalised orig="ty'd" auto="true">tied</normalised> to no thing. After the Adjournment the Judges met again, and having Sufficient Evidence of several Mallefices done by each of the <normalised orig="Seaven" auto="true">Seven</normalised> above-named, with the <normalised orig="Testimonys" auto="true">Testimonies</normalised> of the five Confessing Witches, all <normalised orig="concuring" auto="true">concurring</normalised> in the same Acts, <normalised orig="Sentenc'd" auto="true">Sentenced</normalised> them to be <normalised orig="burn'd" auto="true">burned</normalised> the 10th. of June, which was accordingly Executed. The other 14 being Respited till the Kings Advocates Pleasure, among whom is one <normalised orig="Morison" auto="true">Morrison</normalised> Wife to Francis Duncan in Greenock <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> in the paper the Devils Gentlewife Antiochia, on whom many marks are found; of which <normalised orig="you'l" auto="true">you'll</normalised> receive further Information by the Incloas'd to which I referr you, and am, Sir,

Your much <normalised orig="oblig'd" auto="true">obliged</normalised> Humble Servant, T. P.

A <normalised orig="NARATIVE" auto="true">NARRATIVE</normalised> Of the RECOGNITION Taken by the Commissioners, Appointed by the Lords of His Majesties Privy-Council, for Enquiring into the Witchcrafts, and Witches, in the Shirrifdom of Renfrew; with Relation to the Afflicted Case of Christian Shaw, Daughter to the <normalised orig="Laird" auto="true">Lord</normalised> of Bargarren. At the Place of Bargarren, Feb. 5. 1697. Present, the Lord Blantyre, &c.
THE said Christian Shaw, being Confronted with one Iames Lindsay (whom Elizabeth Anderson, one of the Confessing Witches Under-written Declared, Was one of the said Christians Troublers in her Fits) Did, upon
Touching the said Iames, take a very Violent Fit, Leaping, Starting and Staring, with such a Stiffning of all her <normalised orig="Joynts" auto="true">Joints</normalised>, that it was hard for the Assistants to keep her from Falling, and, at last, fell, as quite Dead, and Senseless, for some time; and, after Recovery, being Confronted with one Catherine Campbell, who being once Servant to her Father, for a Mis-representation of her to her Mistress, <normalised orig="Curst" auto="true">Cursed</normalised> her; and is the Aledg'd Instrument of all the said Christian her Trouble. The said Katherine being by the said Commissioners Interrogate on several Points, in the Hearing of the said Christian, she <normalised orig="Deny'd" auto="true">Denied</normalised> all, and particularly her Accession to the said Christian her Trouble, or the Rise thereof. But the Child still Charging her, Conjured her to tell the Commissioners, Why she would never Pray, That God would deliver her from that Ill, and Restore her well again. Katherine did not disown her Refusal, but shifted about for frivolous Excuses which the Commissioners bearing home on her, as a Great Argument of her Guilt; and finding she could hardly evade the Force of it, Katherine offers to run at the Child (they being then at some distance from one another) and the Child did all she could to shun her Touch. Katherine <normalised orig="Complain'd" auto="true">Complained</normalised>; saying, Now I would Pray for her, but she will not let me. But the Child being <normalised orig="forc'd" auto="true">forced</normalised> to suffer her Touch by the <normalised orig="By-standers" auto="true">Bystanders</normalised>, the most Unwillingly, and with great Fear, she immediately after fell down, in a most Violent Fit, as before, on Iames Lindsay's Touch: But thereupon Katherines Tongue was loosed, and she said, The Lord Bless her, The Lord Deliver her; which nothing could Oblige her to do before: And the Child her self declared, after that Fit, and Katherines Prayer, she now found her self free of all Fear to Touch the said Katherine, or any other of her Tormentors.
The Commissioners were then Earnest with Katherine, to tell why she would, or could not Pray before she <normalised orig="Touch'd" auto="true">Touched</normalised> the Child? But, to this, she could give no Satisfactory Answer.

Afterwards the Commissioners <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> a Young Damsel, <normalised orig="Nam'd" auto="true">Named</normalised> Elizabeth Anderson, whom they found a very Useful Person in the said Enquiry, as being many times admitted by her
Father, and other Friends, to their Meetings with the Devil, as her Confession hereto <normalised orig="Subjoyned" auto="true">Subjoined</normalised> does Evidence, to which you are <normalised orig="Referr'd" auto="true">Referred</normalised>. As also the Commissioners having <normalised orig="Examin'd" auto="true">Examined</normalised> Christian Shaw, about the Persons Represented to her as her Tormentors in those Fits; and finding her Testimony Confirmed by Elizabeth Anderson her Confession, with relation to many of the Persons Accused by Christian. The Commissioners, on that Evidence, Ordered them all to Prison, (viz.) Alexander Anderson, Father to the said Elizabeth, Agnes Nasmith, Iohn Lindsay in Barrcloch, Iohn Lindsay in Formachin, Iames Lindsay his Brother, Agnes Foster, Margaret Fulton, and the said Katherine Campbell, where they are to lie till farther Orders. But the said Christian Shaw knows and remembers another Person, whom she declares she has not the Power to Name: And she has many times attempted it, but is still seized with Fits when she Assays to Express it; She came, at last, to say, for her first Name, Margaret, or <normalised orig="Pincht" auto="true">Pinched</normalised> Margaret (a Name given her by the Devil, from a <normalised orig="Pincht" auto="true">Pinched</normalised> Cross-Cloath, ordinarily worn on her Brow) But cannot express her Patronimick, or Surname. The Commissioners were so <normalised orig="concern'd" auto="true">concerned</normalised> at this, that they urged her to Write it, which being <normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> to try for fear of Torture, she nevertheless essayed it; And beginning to Write other Names, she was <normalised orig="desir'd" auto="true">desired</normalised> to try that too, but could Write no more save Margaret, and the Letter L. of her <normalised orig="Sirname" auto="true">Surname</normalised>, being presently taken with a most Violent Fit, the Pen falling out of her hand, and she falling Dead, as above, with Groans, heavier and sorer then ordinary. Within a while the Commissioners having <normalised orig="caus'd" auto="true">cause</normalised> her to take a little of a <normalised orig="Julip" auto="true">Julep</normalised>, after her Recovery, some Ministers standing by, Presented her with a Bible, desiring her to Read a Passage in it, which they pointed to her; but no sooner had she cast her eyes on the Book, but instead of Reading, she fell to Sing a very Melodious Tune, such as is used in Opera's; and, within a little while after fell in her Fits again, and even then the <normalised orig="Musick" auto="true">Music</normalised> <normalised orig="ceas'd" auto="true">ceased</normalised> not, tho she <normalised orig="appear'd" auto="true">appeared</normalised> as one dead, with her Mouth open, but neither her Lips nor Tongue stirring, She <normalised orig="remain'd" auto="true">remained</normalised> long in the Fit, till one of the Commissioners,

<normalised orig="desir'd" auto="true">desired</normalised> the Book might be <normalised orig="Clos'd" auto="true">Closed</normalised>; which done, she Immediately came to her Self; and being <normalised orig="Askt" auto="true">Asked</normalised> what she meant by Singing, when she was <normalised orig="desir'd" auto="true">desired</normalised> to Read, she was not sensible she had Sung, and <normalised orig="declar'd" auto="true">declared</normalised> she did not remember it.

About a Month after her Grandmother and she were both in the House together, when the aforesaid Gentleman appeared to them, (which the said Elizabeth then suspected to be the Devil) and he and her Grandmother fell a talking together, by rounding in others Ears, but understood not what they said; and <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterword</normalised> her Grandmother desired her to take the Gentleman by the hand, but she refusing, saying, It was the Devil, which her Grandmother denying, said, It was a Gentleman a Friend of hers; and she still insisting and <normalised orig="threatning" auto="true">threatening</normalised> her if she would not take him by the hand, she would get none of her <normalised orig="Cloaths" auto="true">Clothes</normalised>, but the said Elizabeth Anderson would not be <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> to do it, but saved her self from him, saying, the Lord be between me and him, whereupon her Grandmother said, she need not fear for it was not ill thing, and upon that the Devil went away in a Flight, she knew not how; and declares, for a long time after, she was no more troubled with the said Gentleman.
