She further said that the <normalised orig="divell" auto="true">devil</normalised> promised her, that she should not <normalised orig="lacke" auto="true">lack</normalised>, and that she had money sometimes brought her she knew not whence, sometime one shilling, sometimes eight pence, never more at once; <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> called her <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> by the name of <normalised orig="Bunne" auto="true">Bun</normalised>. She further saith, that her retainer <normalised orig="Bunne" auto="true">Bun</normalised> carried Thomas Gardler out of a window, who fell into a backside. She further saith, that <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> twenty <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> since she promised her <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> to the <normalised orig="divell" auto="true">devil</normalised>.

and that the time is now almost expired. She further saith that Iane Hot, Elizabeth Harris, <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> Argoll were her <normalised orig="fellowes" auto="true">fellows</normalised>. She further saith that her <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> told her that Elizabeth Harris about six or seven <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> since <normalised orig="curst" auto="true">cursed</normalised> the Boat of one Iohn Woodcott, and so it came to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised>. <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> further saith, that the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> promised her that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> should not <normalised orig="sinke" auto="true">sink</normalised> being <normalised orig="throwne" auto="true">thrown</normalised> into the water.

thing upon her <normalised orig="bosome" auto="true">bosom</normalised> which was very soft, and she thrust it off with her hand; and she saith that when she had thrust it away she thought God <normalised orig="forsooke" auto="true">forsook</normalised> her, for she could never pray so well since as she could before; and further saith, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> verily <normalised orig="thinkes" auto="true">thinks</normalised> it was alive.

THis Examinant saith, that in the same <normalised orig="yeere" auto="true">year</normalised> that this Major was formerly Major the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> came to her in the shape of a <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> rugged Dog, in the night time, and crept into the bed to her, and spake to her in mumbling language; The next night it came to her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and required this examinant to deny God and <normalised orig="leane" auto="true">lean</normalised> to him, and that then he would revenge her of any one she owed ill will to, and thereupon this examinant promised him her <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> upon those conditions; And that about that time the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> sucked this examinant, and hath divers times since sucked her, and that it was no <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> to her.


September 27. 1645.
<normalised orig="COnfest" auto="true">Confessed</normalised> upon the examination of <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> Carriden before Master Major, that Goodwife Hoâ€¢t told her within these two <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> that there was a great meeting at Goodwife Panterys house, and that Goodwife Dadson was there, and that Goodwife Gardner should have been there, but did not come, and the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> sat at the upper end of the Table.

The Examination of Jane <normalised orig="Hott" auto="true">Hot</normalised> <normalised orig="widdow" auto="true">widow</normalised>, taken before the Major and Jurates the 25 of September, 1645.
THis examinant <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised> that a thing like a <normalised orig="hedghog" auto="true">hedgehog</normalised> had usually visited her, and came to her a great while <normalised orig="agoe" auto="true">ago</normalised>, about twenty <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> <normalised orig="agoe" auto="true">ago</normalised>, and that if it sucked her it was in her sleep, and the <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> thereof awaked her, and it came to her once or twice in the <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised> and sucked her, and when it lay upon her breast she <normalised orig="strucke" auto="true">struck</normalised> it off with her hand, and that it was as soft as a Cat.

At her first <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> into the <normalised orig="Goale" auto="true">Goal</normalised> she spake very much to the other that were apprehended before her, to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> if they were guilty; and stood to it very perversely that she was <normalised orig="cleare" auto="true">clear</normalised> of any such thing, and that if they put her into the Water to try her she should <normalised orig="certainely" auto="true">certainly</normalised> <normalised orig="sinke" auto="true">sink</normalised>. But when she was put into the Water and it was apparent that she did flote upon the water, being taken forth, a Gentleman to whom before she had so confidently spake, and with whom she offered to lay twenty shillings to one that she could not swim, asked her how it was possible she could be so impudent as not to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised>, when she had so much <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> the other to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>: to whom she answered, That the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> went with her all the way, and told her that she should <normalised orig="sinke" auto="true">sink</normalised>; but when she was in the Water he sate upon a Crosse-beame and laughed at her.

These three were executed on <normalised orig="Munday" auto="true">Monday</normalised> last.

THis examinant saith, that about 19 <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> <normalised orig="agoe" auto="true">ago</normalised> the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> did <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> to her in the <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of a Muse: she further saith, that she had a desire to be revenged, and the <normalised orig="divell" auto="true">devil</normalised> told her that she should be revenged; she called the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> her <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised>. She further saith, Goodman Chilman of Nuenham said that she stole a <normalised orig="Pigge" auto="true">Pig</normalised>, then she desired that God would revenge her of him, and the man pined away and dyed, and she saw it apparent that her <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised> was the cause of that mans death; she further saith, that the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> bid her to forsake Christ and <normalised orig="leane" auto="true">lean</normalised> to him, whereupon she saith that she scratched her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> with her <normalised orig="nailes" auto="true">nails</normalised> and fetched blood from her breast, and she wiped it with her finger and gave it to her <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised> who wrote the covenant with it: she further saith, that a fortnight after the <normalised orig="divell" auto="true">devil</normalised> sucked her, but she felt no <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised>. Being demanded how many Witches were in Town? she answered, that were a heavy sentence. She further saith that Goodwife Dadson, <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> <normalised orig="Argoe" auto="true">Ergo</normalised>, William Argos wife, Goodwife Cox have very bad tongues; She further saith that her <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised> did <normalised orig="sucke" auto="true">suck</normalised> her every three or <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> nights; she further saith that her <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> being drowned in Goodman Woodcots High she wished that God might be her revenger, which was her watchword to the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, and this High was cast away, and she conceives that her wish was the cause of its being cast away: she further saith, that <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> Williford told her, that her <normalised orig="Impe" auto="true">Imp</normalised> said


on Wednesday last, that though the <normalised orig="Boate" auto="true">Boat</normalised>, (she not knowing what Boat,) went <normalised orig="chearfully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised> out, it should not come so <normalised orig="chearfully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised> home; She saith further, that Goodwife Pantery did many times make meetings with Goodwife Williford and with Goodwife <normalised orig="Hott" auto="true">Hot</normalised>; She further saith, that Goodwife Gardner hath a very ill tongue.
