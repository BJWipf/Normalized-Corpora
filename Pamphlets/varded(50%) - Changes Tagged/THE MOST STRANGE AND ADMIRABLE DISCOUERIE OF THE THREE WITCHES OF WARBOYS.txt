At length, though long first, gentle Reader, this notable arrainment and examinations of <normalised orig="Samwell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, his wife, and daughter, for their sundry witchcrafts in Huntingtonshire are com to view.  It hath for <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> cause <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> thus long deferd, <normalised orig="aswell" auto="true">as well</normalised> that nothing might escape <normalised orig="vntoucht" auto="true">untouched</normalised> which they had done, as that <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> thing might be <normalised orig="throughly" auto="true">thoroughly</normalised> sifted least it should <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> any way corruptly.  These cares <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> perfected the <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>, it is now past the <normalised orig="presse" auto="true">press</normalised> to your presence, wherein I presume ye shall find matter as admirable as <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> this age afforded.


A True and <normalised orig="perticular" auto="true">particular</normalised> <normalised orig="Obseruation" auto="true">Observation</normalised> of a notable piece of Witchcraft practised by Iohn <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> the Father, Alice <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> the Mother, & Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> their Daughter, of VVarboise in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Huntington, <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> <normalised orig="fiue" auto="true">five</normalised> Daughters of Robert Throckmorton of the same <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised> and <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> Esquire, and <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> other Maide-seruants to the number of <normalised orig="twelue" auto="true">twelve</normalised> in the whole all of them being in one house: <normalised orig="Nouember" auto="true">November</normalised>, 1589.

About the tenth of November which was in the <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> 1589.  <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Iane one of the daughters of the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Master Throckmorton being <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> the age of <normalised orig="tenne" auto="true">ten</normalised> <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, fell <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> into a strange <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of <normalised orig="sickenes" auto="true">sickness</normalised> and distemperature of body, the manner whereof was as <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>.  Sometimes <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> neese very <normalised orig="lowd" auto="true">loud</normalised> and <normalised orig="thicke" auto="true">thick</normalised> for the space of <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> an <normalised orig="howre" auto="true">hour</normalised> together; and presently as one in a great rance and sound lay quietly as long, <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> after she <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> begin to swell and <normalised orig="heaue" auto="true">heave</normalised> up her <normalised orig="bellie" auto="true">belly</normalised> so as none was able to <normalised orig="bende" auto="true">bend</normalised> her, or <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, sometime <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would shake one <normalised orig="legge" auto="true">leg</normalised> and no other part of her, as if the <normalised orig="paulsie" auto="true">palsy</normalised> had bin in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> and then the other, and <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> after <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> head, as if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had <normalised orig="binne" auto="true">bin</normalised> in fected with the running <normalised orig="paulsie" auto="true">palsy</normalised>: continuing in this case two of three <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, amongst other neighbours in the <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised> there came into the house of master Throckmorton, the foresaid Alice <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> to <normalised orig="visite" auto="true">visit</normalised> this <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, who dwelled in the next house on the Northside of the said Master Throckmorton.  The child when the old woman came into the parlour was held in an other <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> by the fire side, so she went into the chimney corner and sate

<normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> hard by the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, the Grandmother of the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, and the Mother <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> also present, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had not <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> there long, but the child grue something worse than she was at her <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised>, and on the <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> cried (saing) Grandmother <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> where the old witch <normalised orig="sitteth" auto="true">sits</normalised> (pointing to the said mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>) did you <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> see (said the Child) one more like a witch than she is: Take off her blacke-thrumbed <normalised orig="cappe" auto="true">cap</normalised>, for I cannot abide to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> on her.  The mother of the child little then suspecting any such matter (as afterwards fell out) was very angry with her child and rebuked her for saying so, & thinking that it might <normalised orig="proceede" auto="true">proceed</normalised> of some <normalised orig="lightnes" auto="true">lightness</normalised> in the <normalised orig="childs" auto="true">child's</normalised> <normalised orig="braine" auto="true">brain</normalised> by reason of her great neesing and want of <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised>, <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her and laid her <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> upon a bed, and hanged <normalised orig="curtaines" auto="true">curtains</normalised> against the <normalised orig="windowes" auto="true">windows</normalised>, thereby hoping to bring her into a <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised>, but much <normalised orig="adoo" auto="true">ado</normalised> they had to <normalised orig="pacifie" auto="true">pacify</normalised> and quiet the child.  The old woman hearing this sate still, and <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> a word, yet looked very ruefully, as afterwards was <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised> by them that saw her.  The child still continuing her manner of <normalised orig="sickenes" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, rather worse than better, within two <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> after, her parents sent the <normalised orig="childs" auto="true">child's</normalised> urine to Cambridge to Doctor Barrow, a man well <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> to be excellent <normalised orig="skilfull" auto="true">skilful</normalised> in <normalised orig="Phisicke" auto="true">Physic</normalised>, who returned this answer: namely, that he did <normalised orig="perceiue" auto="true">perceive</normalised> no kind of distemperature save <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> that he thought she might be troubled with <normalised orig="wormes" auto="true">worms</normalised>, and therefore sent his medicine accordingly, but the child was no white the better; so within two <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> after they sent <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to the same man, declaring unto him the manner of her fits more at large: <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> that the urine which they then <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> brought to him, <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> no such kind of <normalised orig="disquietnes" auto="true">disquietness</normalised> to be in her body: and to be failling <normalised orig="sickenes" auto="true">sickness</normalised> (which the Parents did suspect to be in the child) he would warrant her <normalised orig="cleare" auto="true">clear</normalised> from that disease.  Then he sent other prescripts as he thought good to purge her body, which <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> no place nor <normalised orig="prevayled" auto="true">prevailed</normalised> any thing in the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> as he looked for.  Then the Parents sent to him the third time (as his desire was to understand howe his <normalised orig="Phisicke" auto="true">Physic</normalised> wrought) declaring that it wrought nothing at all as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> looked for, neither that the child was any way amended.  Then Mister Doctor looking again in the urine, and perceiving the <normalised orig="childs" auto="true">child's</normalised> body to bee in good temper (as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> then <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> for any thing that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="sawe" auto="true">saw</normalised>) <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> whether there was no sorcery or witchcraft suspected in the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> was made no.  Then said he, all surely cannot be well, for it is not

possible, that the <normalised orig="childs" auto="true">child's</normalised> body should be distempered by any natural cause as then was declared to him, and no <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> thereof at all to <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> in the urine: not withstanding for their better assurance (if the messenger woule <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to any other skifull man in the <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised> to take further advise, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> bee very well contented.  Whereupon the messenger went to Master Butler, who considering of the urine, and hearing the <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of the <normalised orig="childs" auto="true">child's</normalised> trouble said, that he thought it might be the <normalised orig="wormes" auto="true">worms</normalised>, which yet he did not <normalised orig="perceiue" auto="true">perceive</normalised> to be by the urine and if it were the <normalised orig="wormes" auto="true">worms</normalised>, that then it was a very strange kind of <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> to bee caused by them in that sort, and appointed the same medicine and <normalised orig="phisicke" auto="true">physic</normalised> (for the <normalised orig="remedie" auto="true">remedy</normalised>) which before <normalised orig="Doctour" auto="true">Doctor</normalised> Barrow had prescribed: which being <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> was not <normalised orig="applyed" auto="true">applied</normalised> to the child, because Master Doctor Barrow had said that if Master Throckmorton (to <normalised orig="whome" auto="true">whom</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> wished very well as he then said, by reason of <normalised orig="auncient" auto="true">ancient</normalised> acquaintance with him) <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> follow his advice, he should not <normalised orig="striue" auto="true">strive</normalised> any more there with by <normalised orig="Physicke" auto="true">Physic</normalised>, nor spend any more money about it: for he <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> said, that he had some experience of the <normalised orig="mallice" auto="true">malice</normalised> of some witches, and he verily thought that there was some kind of <normalised orig="sorcerie" auto="true">sorcery</normalised> & witchcraft wrought towards his <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>.

After which <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> from Master <normalised orig="Doctour" auto="true">Doctor</normalised> Barrow, Master Throckmorton <normalised orig="resolued" auto="true">resolved</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> to rest <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Gods pleasure, not striving any further by <normalised orig="Phisicke" auto="true">Physic</normalised> to <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> his daughter; yet both <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> and his wife were free from any such conceit of witchcraft which Master <normalised orig="Doctour" auto="true">Doctor</normalised> Barrow did suspect; <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> within one ijst <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised> after (the very day and <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> almost observed) two more of his daughters elder than the other by two or three <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, fell into the same like extremities as the other Sister before them was in, and <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> out upon Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>: saying, take her away, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> here before us in a <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> thrumbd Cap, (which kind of Cap indeed <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did usually <normalised orig="weare" auto="true">wear</normalised>, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was not then present) it is <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> (<normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> they) that hath bewitched us, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> will kill us if you doe not take her away.  This thing did something <normalised orig="moue" auto="true">move</normalised> the Parents, and strike into their minds a <normalised orig="suspition" auto="true">suspicion</normalised> of witchcraft, yet <normalised orig="deuising" auto="true">devising</normalised> with themselves for what cause it <normalised orig="shoulde" auto="true">should</normalised> be wrought upon them or their children, they could not image, for they were but newly come to the <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised> to <normalised orig="inhabite" auto="true">inhabit</normalised>, which was but at Michaelmas before, neither had they <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> any occasion (to their

knowledge) either to her or any other, to practise any such <normalised orig="mallice" auto="true">malice</normalised> against them.

Within <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> than a <normalised orig="Moneth" auto="true">Month</normalised> after that, another Sister younger than any of the rest about the age of nine <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> fell into the like case, and cried out of Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> as the other did.

<normalised orig="Soone" auto="true">Soon</normalised> after <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> the eldest Sister of them all, about the age of <normalised orig="fifteene" auto="true">fifteen</normalised> <normalised orig="yeres" auto="true">years</normalised>, was in the same case & worse handled <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised> than any of the other Sisters were, for <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> more strength than they, and <normalised orig="striuing" auto="true">striving</normalised> more with the <normalised orig="Spirite" auto="true">Spirit</normalised> than the rest, not being able to <normalised orig="ouercome" auto="true">overcome</normalised> it, was the more <normalised orig="greeuouslie" auto="true">grievously</normalised> tormented; for it forced her to neese, screetch & <normalised orig="grone" auto="true">groan</normalised> <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="fearefullie" auto="true">fearfully</normalised>, sometime it would <normalised orig="heaue" auto="true">heave</normalised> up her <normalised orig="bellie" auto="true">belly</normalised>, and bounce up her <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> with such violence, that had she not bin kept upon her bed, it could not but <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> greatly <normalised orig="brused" auto="true">bruised</normalised> her body, & many times sitting in a chaier <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> her fit, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would with her often starting, and <normalised orig="heauing" auto="true">heaving</normalised>, almost <normalised orig="breake" auto="true">break</normalised> the chaier <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> sate in: yet was there no <normalised orig="striuing" auto="true">striving</normalised> with them in this case, for the more they <normalised orig="labored" auto="true">laboured</normalised> to <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> them & to <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> them <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, the more violently they were handled, being <normalised orig="depriued" auto="true">deprived</normalised> of all use of their <normalised orig="sences" auto="true">senses</normalised> during their fits, for they could <normalised orig="neyther" auto="true">neither</normalised> see, <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>, nor <normalised orig="feele" auto="true">feel</normalised> any body; only crying out of Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, desiring to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> her taken away from them, who <normalised orig="neue" auto="true">never</normalised> more came, for after <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="perceiued" auto="true">perceived</normalised> her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> to be suspected.

These kide of fits would hold them, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter, either an <normalised orig="howre" auto="true">hour</normalised> or two sometimes <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> the day, yea the whole day, and many times they had <normalised orig="sixe" auto="true">six</normalised> or <normalised orig="seauen" auto="true">seven</normalised> fits in an <normalised orig="howre" auto="true">hour</normalised>, yet when it pleased God to deliver them of their fits, they neither knew what they had said, neither yet in what sort they had bin <normalised orig="delt" auto="true">dealt</normalised> with all as hereafter <normalised orig="shalle" auto="true">shall</normalised> be declared in <normalised orig="perticuler" auto="true">particular</normalised>.

After that <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> had <normalised orig="binne" auto="true">bin</normalised> thus handled a while, the <normalised orig="Spirite" auto="true">Spirit</normalised> as it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> would sound in her <normalised orig="eares" auto="true">ears</normalised> some <normalised orig="thinge" auto="true">thing</normalised> which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would declare in her fit, and amongst the rest, it <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> unto her one time, that there should bee twelve of them which should be bewitched in that house, in one <normalised orig="sorte" auto="true">sort</normalised> or other, and named them all unto her, being all women <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised>, and <normalised orig="servantes" auto="true">servants</normalised> in the house, her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> and her Sisters being <normalised orig="fiue" auto="true">five</normalised> of the number, all which <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> afterwards very ture, for they had all their <normalised orig="seuerall" auto="true">several</normalised> <normalised orig="griefes" auto="true">griefs</normalised>, and most of them aflicted in the same sort and manner as

these <normalised orig="fiue" auto="true">five</normalised> Sisters were, Of <normalised orig="whome" auto="true">whom</normalised> and the manner of their faith, if it should bee written in <normalised orig="perticular" auto="true">particular</normalised> how they were <normalised orig="delt" auto="true">dealt</normalised> <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>, there would be no end of this <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>.

And this may suffice to be <normalised orig="knowen" auto="true">known</normalised> concerning the <normalised orig="seruantes" auto="true">servants</normalised>, that when they first fell into their fits, they all cried out of Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, as the Children did, saying take her away <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised>, for Gods sake take her away and <normalised orig="burne" auto="true">burn</normalised> her, for <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> will kill us all if you let her alone, <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> the same miseries and extremities that the children had, and when they were out of their <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> they knew no more than the children did, what either they had done or <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>: and presently upon their departure from <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Throckmortons house they were all <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> well, as at any time before, & so <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> continued <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> since without suspicion of any such kind of vexations, and those servuantes that came in their places for the most part of them, they were aflicted in the like <normalised orig="sorte" auto="true">sort</normalised> as the other for the space of two years together.

<normalised orig="Uppon" auto="true">Upon</normalised> <normalised orig="Fryday" auto="true">Friday</normalised>, being Saint Ualentines <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised>, the thirteenth of <normalised orig="Februarie" auto="true">February</normalised> in the two & thirteth <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> of her <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="raigne" auto="true">reign</normalised>, Gilbert Pickering of Thichmersh <normalised orig="groue" auto="true">grove</normalised>, in the <normalised orig="countie" auto="true">county</normalised> of Northampton Esquier, being uncle to the said <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised>, and hearing how strangely they were vexed and troubled went to VVarboyse (as well as to <normalised orig="visite" auto="true">visit</normalised> and see them, as also to comfort their <normalised orig="Parentes" auto="true">Parents</normalised>: <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> to the house where they were, <normalised orig="founde" auto="true">found</normalised> them all at that present very well, as any children could bee and about one <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> <normalised orig="howre" auto="true">hour</normalised> after, the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Pickering was informed that one <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Andley and <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> VVhittell of Saint Tues, and others were gone to the house of Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> to <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> to come to see, and to <normalised orig="visite" auto="true">visit</normalised> the said Children, and because they tarried <normalised orig="longe" auto="true">lunge</normalised>, it seemed to the said <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Pickering that they could not bring <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised>, although that the said Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, had often <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would come to the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> children, <normalised orig="whensoeuer" auto="true">whenever</normalised> it pleased their Parents to send for her, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="venter" auto="true">venture</normalised> <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> life in water up to the chin; and loose some <normalised orig="parte" auto="true">part</normalised> of <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> best <normalised orig="bleud" auto="true">blood</normalised> to doe them any good: but now as it seemed, her <normalised orig="mide" auto="true">mid</normalised> was <normalised orig="cleane" auto="true">clean</normalised> altered, the cause was as it was suspected, for that all the said children (as it is said before) in their fits cried out of her, saying that she had bewitched them, and that she also feared, the common practise of scratching would be used on her, which nothing <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised>

at that present was intended, for both the Parents and the said M. Pickering had take <normalised orig="aduice" auto="true">advice</normalised> of good Divines of the unlawfulnes thereof, wherefore the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> M.

I charge three doe not <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> any thing, which the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Masiter Pickering, being <normalised orig="behinde" auto="true">behind</normalised> them <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised> thrust his head as <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> as he could <normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised> their heads <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> the words were spoken and hearing them, <normalised orig="presentlye" auto="true">presently</normalised> <normalised orig="replyed" auto="true">replied</normalised> to <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, thou naughty woman, dost thou charge thy daughter not to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> any <normalised orig="thinge" auto="true">thing</normalised>, nay saith she I said not so, but I charged her to hasten <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> self home to get <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> Father his dinner. In the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> time, <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> these words were in speaking M. VVhittle <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Andley, and others went into the house, and three of the Children were then standing in the hall by the fire <normalised orig="perfecte" auto="true">perfect</normalised> well, but no sooner had

Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> entered the hall, but at one moment, the said three Children fell <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> upon the ground strangely tormented, so that if they had bin let lie still on the ground, they <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> have leaped & sprung like a quick <normalised orig="Pickerell" auto="true">Pickerel</normalised> newly taken out of the water their bellies <normalised orig="heauing" auto="true">heaving</normalised> up their head, & their <normalised orig="heeles" auto="true">heals</normalised> still touching the ground as though they had <normalised orig="binne" auto="true">bin</normalised> tumblers, and <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> have <normalised orig="drawen" auto="true">drawn</normalised> their heads and their <normalised orig="heeles" auto="true">heals</normalised> together backwards, throwing out their <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, with great <normalised orig="grones" auto="true">groans</normalised> most strangely to bee heard, to the <normalised orig="greate" auto="true">great</normalised> <normalised orig="greefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> of the beholders, but not <normalised orig="longe" auto="true">lunge</normalised> after they were thus fallen to the <normalised orig="grounde" auto="true">ground</normalised>, the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Master Whittle <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> up one of the said Children, which was Jane Throckmorton, & carried her into an inward chamber laying her upon a bed, and being a man of as great strength as most be this day in England and the child not <normalised orig="aboue" auto="true">above</normalised> nine <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> old, yet he could not hold her <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> on the bed, but she would <normalised orig="heaue" auto="true">heave</normalised> up her <normalised orig="bellie" auto="true">belly</normalised> <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> bigger and in higher measure for her proportion, than any woman with child <normalised orig="readie" auto="true">ready</normalised> to be <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised>, her <normalised orig="bellie" auto="true">belly</normalised> being as hard as though there had <normalised orig="binne" auto="true">bin</normalised> for the present time a great <normalised orig="loafe" auto="true">loaf</normalised> in the same, and in such manner it would rise and fall an hundred times in the space of an <normalised orig="howre" auto="true">hour</normalised>, her <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> being closed as though <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had bin blind and her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> <normalised orig="spred" auto="true">spread</normalised> abroad, so <normalised orig="stiffe" auto="true">stiff</normalised> and strong, that the strength of a man was not able to bring them to <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> body: then the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Master Pickering went into the Parlour where the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> was, and standing on the further side of the bed from the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> <normalised orig="vewing" auto="true">viewing</normalised> the order of her, presently the said child <normalised orig="streatched" auto="true">stretched</normalised> forth her right <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised>, to that side of the bed next to the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Master Pickering, and there scratching the <normalised orig="couering" auto="true">covering</normalised> of the bed said these <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> very often, Oh, that I had her, Oh that I had her: whereupon, the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Master Pickering was in great admiration what the meaning of the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> words should tend unto, and the rather for that the said Master Gilbert Pickering was of that opinion, that scratching was <normalised orig="meerely" auto="true">merely</normalised> <normalised orig="unlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised>, yet the said Master Pickering put his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> hand to the childes hand <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> she was speaking the <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>, but the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> feeling his hand <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> not scratch it, but she <normalised orig="forsooke" auto="true">forsook</normalised> his hand and scratched still on the bed, her face being turned to the contrary side from the said Master Pickering, her <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> being closed, & Master Whittle lying in a manner with his whole body and <normalised orig="waight" auto="true">weight</normalised> over her, to hold <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> her
<normalised orig="bellie" auto="true">belly</normalised>, fearing that she would have burst her <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>.

Not withstanding, the occasion being thus offered by the child, or rather by the <normalised orig="Spirite" auto="true">Spirit</normalised> in the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> to disclose some secret, <normalised orig="wherby" auto="true">whereby</normalised> the Witches might be by some <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> or token made manifest and <normalised orig="knowen" auto="true">known</normalised>, the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Master Pickering went into the Hall and <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> by the hand (who went as willingly as a <normalised orig="Beare" auto="true">Bear</normalised> to the stake) and brought her to the further side of the bed from the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, who lay scraping with her <normalised orig="nailes" auto="true">nails</normalised> on the bed <normalised orig="couering" auto="true">covering</normalised>, saying, Oh that I had her, then the said M. Pickering in <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> soft <normalised orig="speaches" auto="true">speeches</normalised> (so that the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> could not <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>) said to Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> put your <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised> to the childes <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised>, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would not then the said Master Pickering for examples sake, put his hand to the childes hand, so did also <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Andley & others at the same instant, but the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> would scarce touch, much <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> scratch any of their <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised>, then the said Master Pickering without either malice to the woman, confidence, or <normalised orig="opynion" auto="true">opinion</normalised> in scratching (<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to <normalised orig="tast" auto="true">taste</normalised> by this experiment whereto the childes <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> would tend) <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> Mother Samuels <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised> and thrust it to the childes hand, who no sooner felt the same but presently the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> scratched her, with such <normalised orig="vehemencie" auto="true">vehemence</normalised> that her <normalised orig="nailes" auto="true">nails</normalised> brake into <normalised orig="Spylles" auto="true">Spills</normalised> with the force and earnest desire that she had to <normalised orig="reuenge" auto="true">revenge</normalised>: <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> was thus scratching, the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Master Pickering did <normalised orig="couer" auto="true">cover</normalised> Mother Samuels <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised> with his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised>, to <normalised orig="trie" auto="true">try</normalised> what the child would doe in this <normalised orig="extraordinarie" auto="true">extraordinary</normalised> passion, but the child would not scratch his <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised>, but felt to and fro on upon the bed for that which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> missed, and if by any <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> come with her <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised>, or but with one of her fingers to touch Mother Samuells hand, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> scratch that <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised> <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> and none other: Yea, sometimes, <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Master Pickering with his <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised> did cover mother Samuels hand, the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> would put one of her fingers <normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised> the fingers of the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Master Pickering, and scratch mother Samuels <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised> that lay nethermost with that one finger, all her other fingers lying on the hand of the said Master Pickering without <normalised orig="mouing" auto="true">moving</normalised>.

And in this passion, if at any time mother Samuels hand had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> hidden or withdrawn from the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> mourned and <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> <normalised orig="apparant" auto="true">apparent</normalised> tokens of dislike, as though there had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> some great <normalised orig="discurtesie" auto="true">discourtesy</normalised> offered, and this is to bee noted

for a most <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> truth, for so it was by the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Master Pickering at the Assizes in Huntington <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> in evidence, that the Child s eyes were closed, so that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could not see any person, for so was the order of their <normalised orig="Fittes" auto="true">Fits</normalised>; and though <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> at that present <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> have <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised>, yet the childes <normalised orig="heade" auto="true">head</normalised> and <normalised orig="necke" auto="true">neck</normalised> were so turned <normalised orig="backeward" auto="true">backward</normalised> into Master Whettels <normalised orig="bosome" auto="true">bosom</normalised> who covered (as before is <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>) both her head, face, and body, with his body, in such fore so close, that it was unpossible for the child to see the company which stood on the further side of the bed.

This <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> done, the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Master Pickering departed out of that place into an other Parlour, where there was a woman holding one of the other children, which child as the said master Pickering passed by, scraped the <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> Apron that held her, saying: Oh that I had her, Oh that I had her. Then the said master Pickering went into the hall, and did bring Cicely Burder to the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, and for <normalised orig="breuity" auto="true">brevity</normalised> sake, as the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> master Pickering did with mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> to the first child, so did he to Cicely Burder, and as the first child did to mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, so this second child did to Cicely Burder in all respects.

There was also a third <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> also at that present in the hall, which spake the same <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>, but the father of the children, and master Doctor Dorington Parson of the same parish, came then into the house, not allowing that which was done, by reason whereof the third was not put in <normalised orig="proofe" auto="true">proof</normalised>.

The same night after supper, the children being all very well, and out of their <normalised orig="Fittes" auto="true">Fits</normalised>, master Doctor Dorington made motion to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> some prayers before the company departed, the company then kneeling <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, Doctor Dorington began to pray; but  no sooner had he uttered the first word, but <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> at one instant of time all the children fell into their <normalised orig="Fittes" auto="true">Fits</normalised>, with such terrible scrikes and strange neesings, so wonderfully tormented, as though they should have <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="torne" auto="true">torn</normalised> in pieces, which  caused Doctor Dorington to stay in the <normalised orig="middest" auto="true">midst</normalised> of his prayers, and <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> these <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> or the like in effect, were we best to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> any further: but <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had no sooner made stay, and his breath stayed from praying, but the children were quiet (but still in their <normalised orig="Fittes" auto="true">Fits</normalised>) then <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> began to pray <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and then the children or rather the wicked <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> in the children forced them as before, this was <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> often in the time of  

prayer for when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had made an <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised> of any one prayer the children ceased and were quiet: when he began to pray, they began to scrike: when he ended, they ended.

The next day, being Saint Valentines Day, the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Master Pickering brought home to his house at Titchmersh <normalised orig="Groue" auto="true">Grove</normalised> aforesaid, one of the said children called Elizabeth Throckmorton being in her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, who no sooner <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> on <normalised orig="horsebacke" auto="true">horseback</normalised>, and out of Warboyse <normalised orig="Towne" auto="true">Town</normalised>, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was well, and so she continued till <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came into the said Master Pickering's house, but no sooner had she <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> into the house, but that the <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised> <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her <normalised orig="sodainely" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> gasping <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> not able to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> thus it <normalised orig="commeth" auto="true">comes</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> pitched her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> backewards, all the <normalised orig="ioints" auto="true">joints</normalised> of her <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> bone being as it were <normalised orig="drawen" auto="true">drawn</normalised> <normalised orig="togeather" auto="true">together</normalised>, thrusting out her belly so strongly, that none could bend her <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, being very strong and heavy, shaking her <normalised orig="limmes" auto="true">limbs</normalised>, and oftentimes her <normalised orig="heade" auto="true">head</normalised> when it <normalised orig="riseth" auto="true">rises</normalised> so high, but specially her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, like to those which struggle and plunge betwixt life and death, being both <normalised orig="dumbe" auto="true">dumb</normalised>, <normalised orig="deafe" auto="true">deaf</normalised> and <normalised orig="blinde" auto="true">blind</normalised>, her eyes closed up. Now this held her not a quarter of an <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised>, but with a <normalised orig="gaspe" auto="true">gasp</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, stroking her eyes as though she had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> but a <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised>.

Sometimes, <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> taken in her <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is but <normalised orig="deafe" auto="true">deaf</normalised> <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> can <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, or rather (as wee <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised>) the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> in her, but very <normalised orig="vainely" auto="true">vainly</normalised>, and she can see also, but with a small glimmering when, if you <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> upon her, ye would <normalised orig="deeme" auto="true">deem</normalised> her to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> no sight at all. Sometimes also <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> can <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, and not every body, but someone whom <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="liketh" auto="true">likes</normalised> and <normalised orig="chooseth" auto="true">chooses</normalised> out from the rest, sometimes <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="seeth" auto="true">sees</normalised> <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, and as <normalised orig="plainely" auto="true">plainly</normalised> as any other, but neither <normalised orig="heareth" auto="true">hears</normalised> nor <normalised orig="speaketh" auto="true">speaks</normalised> any thing, her teeth <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> set in her <normalised orig="heade" auto="true">head</normalised>, sometimes both hearing and seeing very well, and yet not able to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>.

Above all <normalised orig="thinges" auto="true">things</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="delighteth" auto="true">delights</normalised> in play: <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> will <normalised orig="picke" auto="true">pick</normalised> out someone body to play with her at <normalised orig="Cardes" auto="true">Cards</normalised>, and but one <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, not hearing, seeing, or speaking to any other, but being awake, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="remembreth" auto="true">remembers</normalised> nothing that she did, heard, or spake, affirming that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was not <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> but <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> slept.

She continued well <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> night, and before Supper in time of <normalised orig="thankesgiuing" auto="true">thanksgiving</normalised>, it vexed her very strangely, taking her at the very name of grace, and holding her no longer than grace was in

saying: <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> sate very well at the Table, but no sooner had <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> put up her knife, but it pitched her backewardes, then <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> taken from the table, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was well <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> <normalised orig="thankesgiuing" auto="true">thanksgiving</normalised>, all which time <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was most <normalised orig="grieuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> vexed and no longer. Afterwards <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was very quiet and well <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> motion was made for prayers, all which time it seemed as though it <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> have rent her in pieces, with such,  <normalised orig="scritching" auto="true">scratching</normalised>, and outcries, and vehement neesing, as that it terrified the whole company, but prayers <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> ended <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was quieter, but still in her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>.

Then Master Pickering, and others that were acquainted with the manner of it, <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, that if any should <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> the Bible, or any other Godly <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised> before her, it <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> rage as before so long as they <normalised orig="readd" auto="true">read</normalised>, but because it was a thing very strange, and therefore hardly <normalised orig="beleeued" auto="true">believed</normalised>, one did take a Bible and <normalised orig="readd" auto="true">read</normalised> the first Chapter of Saint John the first verse: At the hearing whereof <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was as one besides her <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>, when he that <normalised orig="readd" auto="true">read</normalised> held his peace <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was quiet: when he <normalised orig="readd" auto="true">read</normalised>, <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> it tormented her: when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> ceased, it ceased: this <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> did <normalised orig="proue" auto="true">prove</normalised> many times.

Nay at the motion of any good <normalised orig="worde" auto="true">word</normalised>, as if any that <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> by <normalised orig="chaunced" auto="true">chanced</normalised> to name God, or prayed God to <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> her, or named any word that teuded to God or <normalised orig="Godlines" auto="true">Godliness</normalised>, it raged all one as if any had read or prayed by her, and thus she was carried to bed still continuing in her <normalised orig="Fitte" auto="true">Fit</normalised>.

In the morning, being a <normalised orig="Sabbaoth" auto="true">Sabbath</normalised> day, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> into the Hall towards prayer time, and being asked whether she would tarry the time of prayers or not, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> answered that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would doe as they <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> her.  Then was <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> asked whether <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> said that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could once, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had almost forgotten now: Then <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> asked further whether <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had prayed that day, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> made <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> it would not suffer her: then whether <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> used to pray at home, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> answered that it would not <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> her so much time.

Then one <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> to her, sith it will not suffer you to pray, not any other (seeming to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="eares" auto="true">ears</normalised>), pray to your <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> secretly in your hart and <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised>, and beginning to tell her that God <normalised orig="understoode" auto="true">understood</normalised> the inward sighs and <normalised orig="grones" auto="true">groans</normalised> of the hart, as well as the <normalised orig="lowdest" auto="true">loudest</normalised> cries of the mouth; <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> <normalised orig="sodainely" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> fell into her <normalised orig="Fitte" auto="true">Fit</normalised> <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> more strongly and strangely tormented than <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was before,

and being carried away, her fits continued and increased  all <normalised orig="prayes" auto="true">prays</normalised> time albeit <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was out of the hearing, which such vehement cries, <normalised orig="scritching" auto="true">scratching</normalised> and <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> neesing, that many times prayers were <normalised orig="constrayned" auto="true">constrained</normalised> to be ceased for the time, so much it amazed the whole company: prayers <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> ended, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> with a <normalised orig="gaspe" auto="true">gasp</normalised>, wiping her eyes being presently as well as any body, as though it had never <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised>.

<normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> came down to dinner, and during the time of grace, it held her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> (which as is <normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised>) yet will it suffer better another to say grace than her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, but no body well: At dinner time it <normalised orig="plaide" auto="true">plaid</normalised> with her, so sometimes <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> hath merry fits, putting her hand besides her <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> and her <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> besides her mouth, mocking her, and making her <normalised orig="misse" auto="true">miss</normalised> her mouth, whereat <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> sometimes smile, and sometimes laugh exceedingly, and amongst many other things this is worthy to bee noted, that <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> in her fit <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> looked far more <normalised orig="sweetely" auto="true">sweetly</normalised> and <normalised orig="chearefully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised> than when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is awake: and although <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> tormented most <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised>, that it would have <normalised orig="grieued" auto="true">grieved</normalised> any to see it, yet <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> once awaked and out of her fit <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is as well as any body. At length Master Gibert Pickering called to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> and experiment which was made at Waboyse, which was, that if one <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> any of those children in their Fits, and carried them into the Churcharde which is <normalised orig="adjoyning" auto="true">adjoining</normalised> to the house, they presently awaked, but bring them in again they were as before, carry them forth, and they came to <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised>: <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> into the house and immediately their Fit <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> them, and this was as often found to be true as <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised>. Hereupon we <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> the like with this <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, and carried her out of the house, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> presently <normalised orig="recouered" auto="true">recovered</normalised>, but within the house it <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>.

But the <normalised orig="certainety" auto="true">certainty</normalised> of this failed us <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> (as <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> is most <normalised orig="uncertaine" auto="true">uncertain</normalised>) yet for three <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> space, if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> were carried abroad in her Fit, it would <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> her, and not take her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> she was brought into the house.

Hereof we <normalised orig="reioyced" auto="true">rejoiced</normalised> greatly with <normalised orig="thankesgiuing" auto="true">thanksgiving</normalised> to God for the childes release in some sort. Hereupon arose a question amongst the <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> that were present at that time what they thought thereof, same said one thing some another, in the <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised> it was thought that the Spirit had it not in commission to molest her abroad, because he is but a <normalised orig="Vassaile" auto="true">Vassal</normalised> to the wicked purpose of her that <normalised orig="detaineth" auto="true">detains</normalised> him.  

As the <normalised orig="Angell" auto="true">Angel</normalised> of God said unto Lot, I can doe nothing till this be come thither, much <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> may the Angels of <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> beyond their commission. But when this imagination was concluded <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised>, and once uttered <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised>, the said experiment presently failed; For now contrarily when she was carried abroad, you would have thought the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> in <normalised orig="daunger" auto="true">danger</normalised> of rending and utter <normalised orig="spoyling" auto="true">spoiling</normalised>, which did greatly <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> and amaze the best that did see it.  But it would be too long to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> all the tricks and collusions of <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> in wresting and over-ruling all the <normalised orig="partes" auto="true">parts</normalised> and members of this <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, yet some <normalised orig="pranckes" auto="true">pranks</normalised> of his <normalised orig="new-fangled" auto="true">newfangled</normalised>  nature shall be reported, who is the prince of this world, and a ring-leader of <normalised orig="newe" auto="true">new</normalised> fashions.

The <normalised orig="obseruations" auto="true">observations</normalised> of <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> follow, from the sixteenth of February to the 26, of that <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised>, she was taken most commonly <normalised orig="fiue" auto="true">five</normalised> or <normalised orig="sixe" auto="true">six</normalised> times a day, sometimes ten times, sometimes twice, <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> once, but not <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> night. On the seventeenth of February she could not <normalised orig="refraine" auto="true">refrain</normalised> from gasping and gaping, and being <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> the cause, she answered, that if forced <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> thereunto. She was then <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> to strive against it, and to shut her mouth, or so to stop it, but still she could not <normalised orig="refraine" auto="true">refrain</normalised>, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> the end, by much strife and contention she overcame it, yet not before it was said in her hearing, that the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> was thought to be a <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> of the <normalised orig="aire" auto="true">air</normalised>, <normalised orig="entring" auto="true">entering</normalised> by a breath and departing by a breath, because it was an <normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised> <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> present awaking out of her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised> and <normalised orig="recouery" auto="true">recovery</normalised>, when she stretched <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, often gasping, and long, with a little rubbing of her <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised>, and thus this <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> gasping ceased with her, but only at suchtimes, as when she awaked out of <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> fit.

On the 26. of February <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> read, and song <normalised orig="Psalmes" auto="true">Psalms</normalised>, <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> well all day <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> the <normalised orig="euening" auto="true">evening</normalised>, when she being in her fit <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> cried out upon the aforesaid mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, fearing and crying, that she would put a mouse into <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> mouth, sometimes a cat, a frog, and sometimes a Toad, clapping <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> hands before <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> mouth. <normalised orig="Sodainly" auto="true">Suddenly</normalised> in this <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised>, she start out of ones <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> that <normalised orig="helde" auto="true">held</normalised> <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised>, and ran away out of the <normalised orig="doores" auto="true">doors</normalised> into another <normalised orig="roome" auto="true">room</normalised>, where <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> legs failed <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised>, an was catched up by one that followed <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised>, still crying away with your mouse mother Samuel, I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> none of your mouse after which time she imagined she had a mouse in her belly.

The 27. of <normalised orig="Februarie" auto="true">February</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was partly well, yet in her fit al the day long, being broad awake, yet nodding at <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> second word, as if she had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="drowsie" auto="true">drowsy</normalised> many times with meat in her mouth, or whatsoever she did, she gave a nod with the head, and that very low <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> minute. This <normalised orig="drowsie" auto="true">drowsy</normalised> fit as sleeping and yet awake, continued <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> two <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised>.

The 28. whereas before it bended her backwards, now it bended her forwards, <normalised orig="coueting" auto="true">coveting</normalised> to touch the ground, as if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would have stood upon her head, turning her hands <normalised orig="cleane" auto="true">clean</normalised> backwards: and if any <normalised orig="mooued" auto="true">moved</normalised> her contrary to her bending, all that present she would cry out, <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> in danger of breaking her <normalised orig="lims" auto="true">limbs</normalised>, neither were any able to bend her straight.

The first day of March at dinner time, she <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> into such sore neesing about <normalised orig="fortie" auto="true">forty</normalised> times together, & faster then one could <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> count them, in so much that <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> issued out of her nose and mouth, but al night in bed, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> fell into the most <normalised orig="sorrowfull" auto="true">sorrowful</normalised> fit of all, weeping with sobs and sighs most pitifully to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> with a strong imagination, crying and could not be appeased (for her senses were all <normalised orig="benummed" auto="true">benumbed</normalised>) saying that now the Witches would kill her Father, destroy both her and al her sisters, this continued <normalised orig="aboue" auto="true">above</normalised> two <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised> after in a sleep she fell into a sore bleeding, at the least a pint at both the nosetrils and the mouth.

In the morning being awaked she remembered no such thing , not that she bled at all. The second of March she had all merry fits, <normalised orig="ful" auto="true">full</normalised> of exceeding laughter (as they were al often times in their fits) and that so <normalised orig="hartely" auto="true">heartily</normalised> and <normalised orig="excessiuely" auto="true">excessively</normalised>, as that if they had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> awaked they would have <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> ashamed thereof, being also full of trifling <normalised orig="toyes" auto="true">toys</normalised>, and some merry <normalised orig="iests" auto="true">jests</normalised> of her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="deuising" auto="true">devising</normalised>, whereat she would force both the standersby, and her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> to laugh greatly.  In this fit she did choose one of her uncles to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to cards with her, as desirous therefore to see the end of it, they <normalised orig="plaied" auto="true">played</normalised> together: <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> after there was a book brought and laid before her, whereat presently she flung <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised> backwards, which being taken away, she presently <normalised orig="recouered" auto="true">recovered</normalised> and <normalised orig="plaied" auto="true">played</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>: this was often <normalised orig="prooued" auto="true">proved</normalised> and found true. And thus playing at cards, her <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> were almost clean shut, but the sight of her <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> were <normalised orig="cleane" auto="true">clean</normalised> <normalised orig="couered" auto="true">covered</normalised>, she saw the cards and nothing <normalised orig="els" auto="true">else</normalised>, she knew her uncle and no man <normalised orig="els" auto="true">else</normalised>, she hard and answered him, and none other, she perceived him when he <normalised orig="plaied" auto="true">played</normalised> <normalised orig="foule" auto="true">foul</normalised>, or did steal from

her, her counters or cards, but any other might take them out of her hands, she not seeing or feeling.  Sometimes she would choose another, whom she did see, and <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>, sometimes a little child, but <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> one and no more in any one fit. The <normalised orig="fift" auto="true">fifth</normalised> day of March she fell into a mourning fit, and longed to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> home to her fathers: on the first day one of her fathers men came <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> to Tichmersh <normalised orig="groue" auto="true">grove</normalised>, <normalised orig="whome" auto="true">whom</normalised> she had often called for in her fit to carry her to Warboyse to her Fathers, saying, that if she were but <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> way, she knew that she <normalised orig="shuld" auto="true">should</normalised> be well, desirous therefore to <normalised orig="proove" auto="true">prove</normalised> it, he carried her <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> <normalised orig="hors" auto="true">horse</normalised> back towards Warboyse, & being scarce gone a bow that, at a pond side she awaked, marveiling where she was, not knowing any thing, but no sooner the horse head was turned <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>, but she fell into her fit <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>.  This was often <normalised orig="prooued" auto="true">proved</normalised> at that time to bee true, now this also fell out infallible: for three <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> after, and no longer, so often as she was carried to the pond (as many <normalised orig="straungers" auto="true">strangers</normalised> desired to see her well and out of her fit) <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> awaked, and was very well, but returning her face <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> she fell <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>.

The eight day of March she caught a new kind of going antique wife, she could <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> very well two steppes, but the third <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> halted <normalised orig="downe-right" auto="true">downright</normalised>, <normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> a beck with her head as low as her knees, and as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was sitting by the fire, she <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> start up, saying, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to Warboyse, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was <normalised orig="staied" auto="true">stayed</normalised> at the <normalised orig="portall" auto="true">portal</normalised> <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>, where going out with a nod, hit her <normalised orig="forhead" auto="true">forehead</normalised> against the latch, which raised a knob the <normalised orig="bignesse" auto="true">bigness</normalised> of a Walnut, it being carried afterwards to the pond, where awaking <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> asked how her face came so hurt. There <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was left all day well, playing in the company of other children at <normalised orig="bowles" auto="true">bowls</normalised> and other sport (for the more foolish sport <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="useth" auto="true">uses</normalised>, the more the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> <normalised orig="spareth" auto="true">spares</normalised> her: but so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as any motion was made of <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> into the house, it presently <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her, so that she was <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> out of her fit within <normalised orig="dores" auto="true">doors</normalised> for twelve <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> together eating and drinking in her fit, but neither, seeing, hearing, nor yet understanding, <normalised orig="cleane" auto="true">clean</normalised> without memory, yet speaking, or rather the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> within her.  The 9. of March <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could not go but hop, for the one leg was <normalised orig="drawne" auto="true">drawn</normalised> uppe and would not touch the ground by a foot, and then being carried to the pond, she awaked now, and her leg was restored. This failed not for other three <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised>, but <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised> she went but upon one leg in the house.

The tenth day after she had eaten some <normalised orig="milke" auto="true">milk</normalised>, she <normalised orig="listned" auto="true">listened</normalised> and

hearkened (as often she would doe) <normalised orig="demaunding" auto="true">demanding</normalised> whether no body heard the spirit in <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> belly lapping the <normalised orig="milke" auto="true">milk</normalised> which she had eaten.

Then she began to dislike all bad things, and delighted in reading saying, that the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> <normalised orig="loued" auto="true">loved</normalised> no <normalised orig="goodnes" auto="true">goodness</normalised>: therefore she burned all the cards that she could come by, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would read when you would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> though she could not <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> the <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>, but <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> it quite closed <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised>, sometimes it tied <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> tongue, sometimes it set her teeth, sometime it would fling away the <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>, especially at any good word, if she could catch the <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>, and be able to hold it still by <normalised orig="striuing" auto="true">striving</normalised>, she would clap it fast to <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> face, until she could see, for sometimes in her reading, it would fling <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> backwards, & swell <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> belly in such sort and <normalised orig="straunge" auto="true">strange</normalised> wise, that strong men were not able to <normalised orig="holde" auto="true">hold</normalised> her <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, in so much that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="complaine" auto="true">complain</normalised> <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, can no man hold me <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, yet the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> was not then ten <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised>.

The <normalised orig="eleuenth" auto="true">eleventh</normalised> day one chanced to <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> her, or rather the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> in <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised>: love you the <normalised orig="woord" auto="true">word</normalised> of God: whereas <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was sore troubled and vexed. But love you Witchcraft? it seemed content: or love you the Bible? <normalised orig="Againe" auto="true">Again</normalised>, it shaked <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised>, but love you Papistry: it was quiet. Love you <normalised orig="praiers" auto="true">prayers</normalised>: it raged. Love you the <normalised orig="Masse" auto="true">Mass</normalised>: it was <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised>. Love you the <normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised>? <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> it <normalised orig="heaued" auto="true">heaved</normalised> up <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> belly: so that what good thing soever you named, it miss-liked, but whatsoever concerning the Popes <normalised orig="paltrie" auto="true">paltry</normalised>, it seemed, pleased, and pacified.

Then the twelfth day she was carried unto the pond, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> halted still, for there is no <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised> in or <normalised orig="certaintye" auto="true">certainty</normalised> in the <normalised orig="Authour" auto="true">Author</normalised> of lies.

The 13, 14, and 15, <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> she passed away the time in a <normalised orig="heauy" auto="true">heavy</normalised> <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, on the 16. day in the afternoon, she start up <normalised orig="suddainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> and ran out of the place where she was, and awaked in the way, but at five of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> it <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> the next day three of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised>; but at <normalised orig="fiue" auto="true">five</normalised> it <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>: and this also <normalised orig="fayled" auto="true">failed</normalised> the third day: yet sitting at supper, she awaked whereat one <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, thanks be to God: at which very words, she <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> backwards into her fit again.

It <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised> to declare, as it hath <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> further very <normalised orig="trulie" auto="true">truly</normalised> obseued in this <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> Elizabeth Throckmorton, remaining at Tichemarsh grove, that <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised> from March to Julie she hath had some vexation of body, which is termed by the name of fits, because of the <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> <normalised orig="maners" auto="true">manners</normalised> thereof, so that she was <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised>


<normalised orig="cleare" auto="true">clear</normalised> and perfectly freed as it may be thought since her first visitation, although in some of the <normalised orig="moneths" auto="true">months</normalised> she had but only one fit. And now because it <normalised orig="seemeth" auto="true">seems</normalised> to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> a fresh one-set and a <normalised orig="newe" auto="true">new</normalised> attempt upon her, we have noted in <normalised orig="perticular" auto="true">particular</normalised> wise how she hath been <normalised orig="diversly" auto="true">diversely</normalised> handled.

For the manner of it, you have heard before to be very <normalised orig="straunge" auto="true">strange</normalised>. It is first perceived commonly to be in her belly, by the great swelling and heaving up thereof from thence, it <normalised orig="ariseth" auto="true">arises</normalised> up into her <normalised orig="throte" auto="true">throat</normalised> stopping the passage of her breath, so that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is oftentimes forced to draw the same with great difficulty and streightues. Remaining there, it <normalised orig="tieth" auto="true">ties</normalised> her tong many times, and <normalised orig="setteth" auto="true">sets</normalised> her teeth together: It will further ascend up into her head, and shake the same as if she had the <normalised orig="paulsie" auto="true">palsy</normalised>, <normalised orig="benumming" auto="true">benumbing</normalised> all her parts, and <normalised orig="depriuing" auto="true">depriving</normalised> her of the use of her senses, sometimes it will be in her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> and hands after the same manner, sometimes in one place, many times in another, and sometimes in all places at once.

For the continuance of it it hath bin either short or longer, mild or more vehement (as it pleased God to permit) for it hath <normalised orig="alwais" auto="true">always</normalised> from the beginning kept a very mutable and <normalised orig="uncertaine" auto="true">uncertain</normalised> course in dealing with them.

Now the 29 of July 1590, she had a fit from <normalised orig="noone" auto="true">noon</normalised> until night sleeping the most part of the time, upon the <normalised orig="thirtie" auto="true">thirty</normalised> she had three <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> fits in the <normalised orig="afternoone" auto="true">afternoon</normalised> going to bed in her fit, but all of them were very <normalised orig="milde" auto="true">mild</normalised> and without any such vehement plunges, and excessive neesing as in former times.

Upon the second of August presently after dinner she <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> very <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> (as many times before) into her ordinary <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of fits, not <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> so much liberty as to say it <normalised orig="commeth" auto="true">comes</normalised>, which words she commoly used to utter in a great hast <normalised orig="imediately" auto="true">immediately</normalised> before the assault, which was very strong and troublesome at this time: yet towards the end, she <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> into a <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised>, and so continued until supper times, when awaking she was very <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised>, and complained that she was griped at her heart and belly, and indeed <normalised orig="marveil" auto="true">marvel</normalised>, for it had sore vexed her; In this sickly fit <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> remained the three next <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> following, eating very <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised>, yet without any <normalised orig="apparant" auto="true">apparent</normalised> <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of swelling or other troublesome fits until the 5. day when she had some few twiches, and some after awakened, yet not ceasing to complain of <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> & pain at her hart and belly. But the next day morning all <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> ceased,
and then <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> fell to her meat cheerfully, and was <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> well as at any time before. But <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised>, the malignant <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> (for it was without question that disquieted the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>) envied her long and good estate, for the same night, before she went to bed, she had two grievous <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, which caused many <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised> to fall from her <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised>, as also from them that stood by, and so she was <normalised orig="caried" auto="true">carried</normalised> to bed. The next morning she was found to be in her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, and so continued the whole day, being in her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, and in her bed, lying as one in a <normalised orig="drowsie" auto="true">drowsy</normalised> <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised>, eating and drinking in her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, speaking very little, but sometimes saying she would <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to Warboyse, for there her sisters were well (as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>) and named some of them whereas when she is out of her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, she is loath to bee <normalised orig="drawne" auto="true">drawn</normalised> <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> place from Tichmarsh grove.

The next day was the 13. of August, she was taken by in her fit and made <normalised orig="readie" auto="true">ready</normalised>, but when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> should come to <normalised orig="moove" auto="true">move</normalised> her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, the one of her legs was <normalised orig="drawne" auto="true">drawn</normalised> close to her <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>, <normalised orig="almoste" auto="true">almost</normalised> a <normalised orig="foote" auto="true">foot</normalised> from the ground, so she sate in a <normalised orig="chaire" auto="true">chair</normalised> al the day <normalised orig="receiuing" auto="true">receiving</normalised> her <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> at due times when it was brought unto her, yet <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="mooued" auto="true">moved</normalised> her countenance, appearing as one in a <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>; bereft of sense and motion, yea, and life (to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> upon) save that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> breathed: yet would she of her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> (for she could neither <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>, see, nor <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> to any) lift up her <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised> in a <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> token of <normalised orig="thanksgiuing" auto="true">thanksgiving</normalised> after meat <normalised orig="receaued" auto="true">received</normalised>, (which is not to be omitted) because it was comfortable to be the beholders.

The 14. of August she was <normalised orig="caried" auto="true">carried</normalised> abroad into the open ayre to see if she could come to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> (as divers times in her former fits she had done) but there is now no change in her, she is the same without the <normalised orig="dore" auto="true">door</normalised> as within, and now <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="beginneth" auto="true">begins</normalised> to <normalised orig="complaine" auto="true">complain</normalised> on that side whereof the leg is <normalised orig="drawne" auto="true">drawn</normalised> up, if any doe but touch her thereon, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> will whimper and <normalised orig="grone" auto="true">groan</normalised> as if it were sore, yet there is no appearance of outward hurt, if you touch her on the other side, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> will laugh after a [???] manner, and <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> <normalised orig="merily" auto="true">merrily</normalised> in the countenance, but there is not one <normalised orig="worde" auto="true">word</normalised> with her all the day long, from this day <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> the eight of September, for she was a whole <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised> together in her <normalised orig="drowsie" auto="true">drowsy</normalised> <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>. <normalised orig="Manie" auto="true">Many</normalised> <normalised orig="thinges" auto="true">things</normalised> happened <normalised orig="woorthy" auto="true">worthy</normalised> the remembrance, as that sometimes <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would sow all the day long, and <normalised orig="mourne" auto="true">morn</normalised> if her <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> were taken from her, sometimes she would <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> <normalised orig="yarne" auto="true">yarn</normalised>, or knit, but <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> cast up her
<normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> or countenance, some <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would bee <normalised orig="mirrie" auto="true">merry</normalised> and lightsome, finding many things wherein she would take delight, as playing with her <normalised orig="cosins" auto="true">cousins</normalised> (children in the house) at some light and childish <normalised orig="sportes" auto="true">sports</normalised>, wherein children doe pastimes <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised>, and all in her fit, as if she were as perfect as any of them.

Sometimes <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would be so heavy and drooping, that she could not sit in her chair, but would cast her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> on the ground, and so lie with a cushen or pillow under her head <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> the day <normalised orig="togeather" auto="true">together</normalised>. Sometimes she would take a <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised> and read either chapter or <normalised orig="praiers" auto="true">prayers</normalised> very well, but <normalised orig="whensoever" auto="true">whenever</normalised> she misread a <normalised orig="worde" auto="true">word</normalised>, or slipped in any thing, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could not <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> any that corrected her, <normalised orig="thogh" auto="true">though</normalised> he had spoken <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> so <normalised orig="lowd" auto="true">loud</normalised>, yet if he had pointed to the place with his finger, or <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> some other <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would have gone <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> and read over the place <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, sometimes reading it true, sometimes not: <normalised orig="Againe" auto="true">Again</normalised>, when she came to this word <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised>, or the <normalised orig="deuil" auto="true">devil</normalised>, she should have much to doe, to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> it quickly, or to <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> the <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised> in her hands, for it would shake her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, and <normalised orig="straine" auto="true">strain</normalised> her body very sore, insomuch that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would oftentimes say, wilt though not suffer me to say my prayers: Wilt thou not suffer me to read: (answering) I will say them, I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> read, with often and vehement repetition, and would in no case forsake her <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>, except by great strife and violence, it cast it <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> of her hands (as many times it did) yet  would not receive it <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> brought unto her, and many times fetch it her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>: and in the end after much contention and much striuings <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> should read quietly: and thus <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was used for the most part <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> night when she went to bed, but especially in time of her <normalised orig="praiers" auto="true">prayers</normalised>.

Further, for the space of two or three <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised>, if <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> named, or the <normalised orig="deuill" auto="true">devil</normalised> unto her, it would have troubled her, and so often those <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> named, so many twitches, which was very <normalised orig="straunge" auto="true">strange</normalised> to <normalised orig="beholde" auto="true">behold</normalised>: Also at the naming of Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> (which will not bee forgotten) it would shake her by the shoulders and <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, as if it would shauer her in <normalised orig="peeces" auto="true">pieces</normalised>, <normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> of great dislicke thereof, and <normalised orig="threatning" auto="true">threatening</normalised> as if there were some <normalised orig="mysterie" auto="true">mystery</normalised> in it.  And sometimes her <normalised orig="verye" auto="true">very</normalised> name would cast her <normalised orig="presentlie" auto="true">presently</normalised> into her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, and <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> in the <normalised orig="middest" auto="true">midst</normalised> thereof, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would say, could you not <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="helde" auto="true">held</normalised> your tongue.

I was well enough before you named her, with many such like speeches, and thus <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> continued long in this <normalised orig="drowsie" auto="true">drowsy</normalised> manuer, speaking very little all the time but that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> say sometimes that she should not be well <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came to VVarboyse, or a mile upon the way, and then <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> should be well. One time she asked the question whether any body in the house had slept so long as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had done, saying that it had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a long night with her, for <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had then continued so five <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, and if every body had slept as since had done meaning the <normalised orig="seruants" auto="true">servants</normalised> of the house) why then I <normalised orig="woonder" auto="true">wonder</normalised> (quoth <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised>) howe all the <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> bee done.

Upon the last day of August, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> has a very <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> and sore <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised> presently after dinner, door <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> out very <normalised orig="griuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> to <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised>, that mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> before her in a white <normalised orig="sheete" auto="true">sheet</normalised> with a <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> sitting <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her shoulders, saying: <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is, away with your <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> I will none of your <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised>, trembling every <normalised orig="ioint" auto="true">joint</normalised>, and sweating marvellously, calling upon her Uncle master Pickering and others to save her from mother Samuels <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised>, and <normalised orig="wich" auto="true">which</normalised> such lamentable speeches because no body would <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> her, that it did greatly <normalised orig="grieue" auto="true">grieve</normalised> those that were present. After this <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised> ended, her teeth were set in her <normalised orig="heade" auto="true">head</normalised>, by which <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> her speech also was taken from her it may bee, because <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> disclosed more than mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> would vouchsafe to have <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised>, after a while <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> greatly mourned inwardly and wept very sore, often putting her hand to her mouth, and shaked very hard. This closing of her mouth did greatly affright us all, because it could not bee that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="shoulde" auto="true">should</normalised> naturally bee <normalised orig="preserued" auto="true">preserved</normalised> without the ordinary <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> of <normalised orig="foode" auto="true">food</normalised>, yet the often experience we had received of Gods merciful providence and care towards the <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised>, vanquished <normalised orig="dispaire" auto="true">despair</normalised> in us, yet could it not but greatly <normalised orig="grieue" auto="true">grieve</normalised> even a <normalised orig="mercilesse" auto="true">merciless</normalised> Chants hart (but that the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> hath no mercy) to see how the <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> wept and lamented, many times putting her <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised> to her mouth, and lifting up her <normalised orig="heade" auto="true">head</normalised>, as <normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> cirsting <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> of an hungry desire for <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> and <normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised>.

Towards night when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> should <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to <normalised orig="bedde" auto="true">bed</normalised>, it pleased God (whose <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> is always at <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised>, when hope was in greatest distress) that this <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> was found out, the <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> wanted a

tooth, whereat by the <normalised orig="helve" auto="true">halve</normalised> of a quill, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> sucked up some <normalised orig="milke" auto="true">milk</normalised>, and the same <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> <normalised orig="receiued" auto="true">received</normalised> her <normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised>. After this was done, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> greatly <normalised orig="rejoyced" auto="true">rejoiced</normalised> in countenance and outwards <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> for <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> not <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, but clapping her <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised> on her breast and belly (as it may be thought) for that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had found out a way to <normalised orig="deceiue" auto="true">deceive</normalised> the malice of her enemy: For the children in all their assaults, though they took the <normalised orig="soyle" auto="true">soil</normalised> for a time, yet <normalised orig="whensoever" auto="true">whenever</normalised> it pleased God a little to ease them, though but in part yet <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> they greatly triumph in <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> if they <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, as to say I <normalised orig="defie" auto="true">defy</normalised> thee thou wicked <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> , doe what thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised>, thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> doe me no hurt, thou <normalised orig="seest" auto="true">see</normalised> that God is stronger than thou, thou art as good to let <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> alone, I am glad at my heart that thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> not overcome me, with many such like speeches, though in the very uttering of them, the enemy seemed to check & to torment them for it,  y <normalised orig="strayning" auto="true">straining</normalised> their body, and stopuing the course of their speech, and if they could not <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, then would they <normalised orig="reioyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> in counternance, and outward <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised>, and this kind of triumphing after the extremity of the <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised> be past, is true in them all, from the eldest to the youngest.

To <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> to this <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised>, who was carried to <normalised orig="bedde" auto="true">bed</normalised> in her <normalised orig="Fitte" auto="true">Fit</normalised>, and in time of her prayers, as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> inwardly mourned than in her <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>, was exceedingly tormented, yet <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> not cease <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had finished them, which rule for the most part she usually kept, for thought her torments increased never so much, yet would <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> not long <normalised orig="surcesse" auto="true">surcease</normalised> her prayers, but after some release and <normalised orig="quietnes" auto="true">quietness</normalised> <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> to her of her enemy, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forward <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> she had ended them which was (no doubt) a good motion of the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> and grace of God in the <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised>.

The next morning which was the first of September <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was taken up in the same manner, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> lay <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, her teeth still remaining fast set <normalised orig="togeather" auto="true">together</normalised>, yet not so: but that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> might <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> <normalised orig="milke" auto="true">milk</normalised> up a quill as before.  At dinner time <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had a little <normalised orig="strugling" auto="true">struggling</normalised> with her <normalised orig="Fitt" auto="true">Fit</normalised> in the end whereof her teeth were lapped one over the other, whereas before they were set but one against the other. 

This was <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> a further degree of <normalised orig="Sathans" auto="true">Sedans</normalised> <normalised orig="malitious" auto="true">malicious</normalised> enmity for now both he closed her teeth and her mouth so fast <normalised orig="togeather" auto="true">together</normalised> that there is no use and <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> left for the quill, this fyrightful and <normalised orig="mercilesse" auto="true">merciless</normalised> [...] of <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> with this <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> had much more troubled us than it did, but that we were verily <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> that the <normalised orig="mallice" auto="true">malice</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, and of his wicked <normalised orig="Instrumentes" auto="true">Instruments</normalised> whoseuer were limited and his <normalised orig="mischieuous" auto="true">mischievous</normalised> purpose <normalised orig="towardes" auto="true">towards</normalised> the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, so [...]rre forth restrained, as that although he might endanger her health (which many times he did) yet should he <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> actually endammage the same, and much <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> her life, hereof we <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> had very comfortable experiences.  For oftentimes (as you may <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> before) <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> so <normalised orig="pitteously" auto="true">piteously</normalised> racked in her body, with such <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> heavings and swellings in her belly, as if it would have broken her <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> or rent her [...] in sunder, such <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> neesing, and that so <normalised orig="thicke" auto="true">thick</normalised> and often together after a screeching manner, filling all the house with her <normalised orig="noyse" auto="true">noise</normalised> as that boude hath gushed out of her nose, and some part at her mouth.  Yet for all this when the Fit was <normalised orig="ouerpassed" auto="true">overpassed</normalised>, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> come <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> as one of us, <normalised orig="cheerfull" auto="true">cheerful</normalised> in countenance, for if you had asked how <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had done, she <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> smile <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> you: if where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> her common <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> was in a sleep or <normalised orig="dreame" auto="true">dream</normalised>..  If a strong man in his perfect health had <normalised orig="strugled" auto="true">struggled</normalised> in such a <normalised orig="storme" auto="true">storm</normalised>, and avid such a brunt but one <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised>, as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> a day <normalised orig="togeather" auto="true">together</normalised> or longer, it had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> no <normalised orig="woonder" auto="true">wonder</normalised>, if <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> a <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised> after: No not if death it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> had followed presently upon it so very strange things suffered this <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>.  But now <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is left destitute of all outward <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> to <normalised orig="relieue" auto="true">relieve</normalised> the body and to <normalised orig="preserue" auto="true">preserve</normalised> <normalised orig="lif" auto="true">life</normalised>; because her mouth is closed up.  It was hereupon therefore thought good y oiners to make some <normalised orig="tryals" auto="true">trials</normalised> and experiments (as they had oftentimes done) before in such like cases, and chiefly because the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> had many times said that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> should not bee well <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came to Warboyse on a mile upon the way.  <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> therefore accompanied with <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Pickering her Aunt, was taken up and carried to <normalised orig="horsebacke" auto="true">horseback</normalised>, whereat <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> presently <normalised orig="ioyed" auto="true">joyed</normalised> much (as if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had perceined what had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> done, for making <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> with her hands she pointed to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> the horse <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> on forward.

Now when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had gone almost a mile <normalised orig="onwarde" auto="true">onward</normalised>, thought not the direct way to Warboyse, yet the same way <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came from thence to Tichmarsh grove as it feel out (for it was unknown to any in the company at that present) <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="begane" auto="true">began</normalised> to <normalised orig="cheere" auto="true">cheer</normalised> up her

<normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> very much, and her teeth were forthwith untied: so that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, I am not yet gone a mile, I shall straight way, and then I shall bee well.  Presently after this, when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had gone a good mile (as it may be thought) <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> rubben her eyes and came to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> and was very well as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, but [...] exceedingly both show <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came thither, and wherefore at the, company also, and the strangeness of teh place.  Afterwards alighting from the horse, her <normalised orig="legge" auto="true">leg</normalised> was restored to her, where of <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had no use of three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> before, and desired her Aunt to pray to God to <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> her.  Thus <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> walked on forwards in very good and perfect estate, her.  Thus <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> walked on forwards in very good and perfect estate, there was <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> brought for her, whereof <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> some part and <normalised orig="dranke" auto="true">drank</normalised> also with good alacrity and <normalised orig="cheerefulnes" auto="true">cheerfulness</normalised>.  <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> a prayer <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised> and <normalised orig="readd" auto="true">read</normalised> of it a good space, but when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came at this word <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> it troubled her fore by shaking and wringing of her shoulders.  And to see the <normalised orig="mallice" auto="true">malice</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, there was no sooner mention made of her going home, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was straight way snatched, and shaken in her shoulders, <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, and body, as it would have shuffled her together, a little after <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> arose, and in the very turning of her face homewardse, her eyes were shut, her legs were taken from her, her teeth fast set in her <normalised orig="heade" auto="true">head</normalised>, her belly began to heave and swell in <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> as usually before when her Fit set upon her.  Now so long as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is walking forwards from the <normalised orig="groue" auto="true">grove</normalised> as it were to Warboyse, so that you <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> not of going <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> (for the motion <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> will cause her to start) <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is very well and merry withouth any <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of dislike so long as either you are going on or standing still.  But so some as <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> you shall <normalised orig="turne" auto="true">turn</normalised> her about to go homewards <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> presently <normalised orig="sinketh" auto="true">sinks</normalised> <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> in your <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> as one fallen into a <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> <normalised orig="swounde" auto="true">swooned</normalised>, <normalised orig="strugling" auto="true">struggling</normalised> betwixt life and death, and so <normalised orig="continueth" auto="true">continues</normalised> stiuing a little space <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> bee <normalised orig="cleane" auto="true">clean</normalised> <normalised orig="ouercome" auto="true">overcome</normalised>, if you in the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> time <normalised orig="turne" auto="true">turn</normalised> not her face <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, which if you doe, as one awaking from <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is returned to her former estate.  This was <normalised orig="prooved" auto="true">proved</normalised> many times at that present both on <normalised orig="foote" auto="true">foot</normalised> and on <normalised orig="horsebacke" auto="true">horseback</normalised> in the fight of many, but in the <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised> (there was no ram by) with great <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> wee brought her <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> the same way wee carried her <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised>: A <normalised orig="deade" auto="true">dead</normalised> <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> for any sense or motion, but in countenance very <normalised orig="sweete" auto="true">sweet</normalised> and amiable, for in all these extremities her complexion (which naturally is <normalised orig="faynte" auto="true">faint</normalised>) was no whit <normalised orig="altred" auto="true">altered</normalised>.  At night, it pleased God in <normalised orig="despight" auto="true">despite</normalised> of <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised> and <normalised orig="mallice" auto="true">malice</normalised>, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="receiued" auto="true">received</normalised> <normalised orig="milke" auto="true">milk</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> by a quill in the same manner as before, yet not without some straining and <normalised orig="straightnes" auto="true">straightness</normalised>, because the place was closer shut than at the first: So that the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> then remained as a suckling and sucking child, for <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="eateth" auto="true">eats</normalised> no meat within the house, which is <normalised orig="substantiall" auto="true">substantial</normalised> and solide.  But such as <normalised orig="passeth" auto="true">passes</normalised> through a quill: and if any meat bee brought unto her, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> will make <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> abroad, pointing towards that place where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is wont to awake.  The next day, therefore, after dinner, she was carried <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, where when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came at the very <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> same place (as one would <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> within the length of a Pole) <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> awakened, as one <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> out of a long <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised>, for she would rub her <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> a <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> before, and <normalised orig="gaspe" auto="true">gasp</normalised> once or twice stretching forth her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, and these were common fore-running <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> when she came to her <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised> estate, there she did eat her meat very <normalised orig="hartely" auto="true">heartily</normalised> with a good appetite, to the great <normalised orig="ioy" auto="true">joy</normalised> of her self, and of those that were present, but when she was satisfied, and about to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> thanks, then <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> appeared in his <normalised orig="likenes" auto="true">likeness</normalised>, for he laboured to <normalised orig="prohibite" auto="true">prohibit</normalised> and hinder that good exercise, by snatching the word as it were out of her mouth, and cutting them in the <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised>, by wringing also and twisting the parts and members of the child, in such sort, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could not bring out one good <normalised orig="woord" auto="true">word</normalised>, & the better word, the greater was her troble to utter it.

After this done, it was thought good by some, that a little <normalised orig="sticke" auto="true">stick</normalised> should be put into her mouth to <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> her teeth open, <normalised orig="whensoever" auto="true">whenever</normalised> she was assiled <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, which was tried: so that when she was turned about, (for it would not suffer her so much as to sit quietly with <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> face homewards, she held the stick fast in her mouth, which kept her teeth open, but she <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> was as one in a dead <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised>, giuning small <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> of any strength, or life, and so remained <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> she was turned about <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, which was not presently <normalised orig="doone" auto="true">done</normalised>, at that time, because wee were willing to see the issue of it.  After a little space <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="stroue" auto="true">strove</normalised> with her hands to <normalised orig="plucke" auto="true">pluck</normalised> the <normalised orig="sticke" auto="true">stick</normalised> out of her mouth, mourning inwardly in her mime with an <normalised orig="heauie" auto="true">heavy</normalised> countenance, as if it had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> much <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> and trouble unto her, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> held it so fast with her teeth, that it could not (as it may be thought) without great force <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> pulled out, which appeared by the great dints of her teeth, made in the <normalised orig="sticke" auto="true">stick</normalised> when she was <normalised orig="recouered" auto="true">recovered</normalised>.

This wee durst not adventure to doo the second time, fearing other inconveniences, for the said, when she was come to her self, that her mouth was very <normalised orig="colde" auto="true">cold</normalised>, for that the stick (as we thought) kept it open.  Howe did we tell her of a quill, by which she bled to <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> her <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> at home, for <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> asked whether she did eat <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> any where else but in that place <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>: but it seemed very strange unto her to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> of a quill, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="knewe" auto="true">knew</normalised> of no such thing, neither could we bring her to <normalised orig="belaeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> that she <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> <normalised orig="sucke" auto="true">suck</normalised> in a quill, for she asked many questions about it, how & which way she should doo it.

Now in the <normalised orig="middest" auto="true">midst</normalised> of this great <normalised orig="heape" auto="true">heap</normalised>, and <normalised orig="worlde" auto="true">world</normalised> of wonders (as we say) appearing in this <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, one thing father by the way is thought good to be <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised>, which is a point wherein many men that <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> it, hardly <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> eyes.  It is a great questions amongst us, and is not yet fully determined, whether the <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> in the present time of her <normalised orig="agonie" auto="true">agony</normalised>, <normalised orig="dooth" auto="true">doth</normalised> sensibly <normalised orig="feele" auto="true">feel</normalised> and partake, <normalised orig="eyther" auto="true">either</normalised> in anguish of <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>, or <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> of body, those pangs and torments which to <normalised orig="outwarde" auto="true">outward</normalised> <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="dooth" auto="true">doth</normalised> appear to doo: it is thought <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="dooth" auto="true">doth</normalised> not, and some reasons shall be <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> that may draw us to <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> it.

First, the testimony of the <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> (<normalised orig="whe" auto="true">when</normalised> she is <normalised orig="recouered" auto="true">recovered</normalised>) might be sufficient to <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> hte matter, if there were nothing <normalised orig="els" auto="true">else</normalised>, for why should not she rather by <normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> her <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> cause us to <normalised orig="mone" auto="true">moan</normalised> and <normalised orig="pitie" auto="true">pity</normalised> her (as all <normalised orig="dooth" auto="true">doth</normalised> that see her) if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> felt any cause why? The <normalised orig="smyling" auto="true">smiling</normalised> and <normalised orig="cheerefull" auto="true">cheerful</normalised> countenance which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> hath always used, to those that <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> her how she <normalised orig="dooth" auto="true">doth</normalised> presently <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her fit ended, may something also strenthen this point.  The earnest desire she hath always had in time of her greatest extremities, to finish her prayers, or any such goo dexercise, although her torments (as they appeared to bee) were the more <normalised orig="encreased" auto="true">increased</normalised> thereby, as usually they were.  Her exceeding <normalised orig="harty" auto="true">hearty</normalised> and immodest laughter in some of her fits, and such in <normalised orig="deede" auto="true">deed</normalised> as the Childes <normalised orig="modestie" auto="true">modesty</normalised> <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> blushed at, and <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> not <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> permitted, if she had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> well.  To these may be added, that the not feeling of her blow and hurt, nor knowing any thing of it, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> she was <normalised orig="recouered" auto="true">recovered</normalised>, which she <normalised orig="reciued" auto="true">received</normalised> in her fore-heade by the latch of a <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>, as you may read before, with many such like arguments which might be <normalised orig="alleaged" auto="true">alleged</normalised>.  And

not to <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> out that which is of most force of all: her open contempt at all times, & in all places, both in speech & gesture, immediately before her fit <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her: her <normalised orig="boldnesse" auto="true">boldness</normalised> & good courage at all times to <normalised orig="aduenture" auto="true">adventure</normalised> upon it, though she knew assuredly it would assault her: as namely, in the beginning of her visitation, at the naming only of God, or Jesus, or any good word, which if you had <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised>, you could not <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> sufficiently admired: also, at the <normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> of <normalised orig="thankes" auto="true">thanks</normalised> after or before meat received at the <normalised orig="entring" auto="true">entering</normalised> upon any good exercise, as reading or praying, she <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> once <normalised orig="useth" auto="true">uses</normalised> to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> any <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> or discouragement, in any respect.  And at the naming of the <normalised orig="devill" auto="true">devil</normalised>, Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, or any such black word, that <normalised orig="keepeth" auto="true">keeps</normalised> the <normalised orig="collour" auto="true">colour</normalised>, as <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> or Cicely (which is another <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> name, that is suspected to be confederate in this wicked practise) she <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> feared nor would <normalised orig="sticke" auto="true">stick</normalised> at them, but <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> ready (though she very well knew that she should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> her fit for it) to cast her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> upon the present danger.  And now <normalised orig="heere" auto="true">here</normalised> in this place which is the open fields, she is willing and forward at <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> motion, to <normalised orig="turne" auto="true">turn</normalised> her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> about, and to set her face homewards <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>.  And surely it may bee thought, there are very few (though hired with great gifts) if they had but once <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> in that pttifull plight and <normalised orig="wofull" auto="true">woeful</normalised> case, wherein she hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a hundred times, that would voluntarily cast themselves into so great an <normalised orig="extremitie" auto="true">extremity</normalised> and hazard of life, yca, though they <normalised orig="ahd" auto="true">and</normalised> received infficient <normalised orig="securitie" auto="true">security</normalised> and assured <normalised orig="warrantie" auto="true">warranty</normalised> both of life and health afterwards, and <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised> for the present time also to be without <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised> sense & feeling of <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised>, and vexation of body or <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>, so full of dread and terror was this <normalised orig="fearefull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> spectacle, to the Standers by many times : and yet hath this little <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> (such is the prehemience of Gods Spirit <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> all <normalised orig="spirites" auto="true">spirits</normalised> of <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>) <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> many of her sisters and some others, <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> times in the like case, or worse (if it might be) handled and tormented.

Yet it cannot bee <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised>, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> many times very sad in <normalised orig="countenaunce" auto="true">countenance</normalised>, and <normalised orig="shedde" auto="true">shed</normalised> some <normalised orig="fewe" auto="true">few</normalised> <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised> a little before her fit hath come <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her: yet without any <normalised orig="complayning" auto="true">complaining</normalised> at all, and of late times also: so that it may bee rather imputed (as it hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> though) to some other causes, as in part to the conceit and imagination of her <normalised orig="cruell" auto="true">cruel</normalised> dealing, when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is in her fits, as it hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> reported in her hearing.  Also, for that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is deprived (for the <normalised orig="tyme" auto="true">time</normalised>) of the company and <normalised orig="fellowshippe" auto="true">fellowship</normalised> of her cozens (other children in the house, <normalised orig="whome" auto="true">whom</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="deerly" auto="true">dearly</normalised> <normalised orig="loueth" auto="true">loves</normalised>) to that great sorrow and anguish of <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>, which the sight of her lamentable case <normalised orig="enforceth" auto="true">enforces</normalised> upon others: or if there bee some other secret cause <normalised orig="unknowne" auto="true">unknown</normalised> unto us, for the <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="complayneth" auto="true">complains</normalised>. And <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> the case of her <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised>, she <normalised orig="wyll" auto="true">will</normalised> auswere, sometimes that her head aketh, or that she hath some <normalised orig="payn" auto="true">pain</normalised> in one part of her body or other: But it would be too large a thing to recite one of an <normalised orig="hundreth" auto="true">hundredth</normalised> almost, of those memorable accidents which <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> befallen to this <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, since the time that it first pleased God to permit her to be visited in this order.

To omit therefore what might be further said, she was carried out of the <normalised orig="fieldes" auto="true">fields</normalised> back again into the <normalised orig="groue" auto="true">grove</normalised>, being more like the Image and <normalised orig="Shaddowe" auto="true">Shadow</normalised> of a <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, then so in <normalised orig="deede" auto="true">deed</normalised>, continuing in the same estate and order at home as <normalised orig="abroade" auto="true">abroad</normalised>, not eating any thing but such melthing meats as <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> through a quill, <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> she would take some buttered meats, very small minced, & rub it against the outside of her teeth, & so suck in the <normalised orig="iuyce" auto="true">juice</normalised> and <normalised orig="moysture" auto="true">moisture</normalised> of it.  From this day, which was the 3. of September, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> Tuesday, which was the 8. of the same <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised>, was she <normalised orig="caryed" auto="true">carried</normalised> abroad into the field <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> day to eat her meat, where she <normalised orig="fayled" auto="true">failed</normalised> not to awake at teh very <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> same place, & not before: And to <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> you that she would come to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> in no other place but in that <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, she hath been <normalised orig="caryed" auto="true">carried</normalised> a more direct way to Warbois, two or three miles upon the way, but to small purpose, for she continued in the same estate.  Upon this tuesday was <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> carried from Tichemarsh grove, to Warbois to her fathers house, where by the way in the fields, at a dhege corner, which was the ordinary place, she made the common <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised>, & presently awaked continuing all the way in very <normalised orig="healthfull" auto="true">healthful</normalised> sort and merry, <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> her greatest care and <normalised orig="greife" auto="true">grief</normalised> was, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was departed from Tichemarshe grove.

Now that you have heard the <normalised orig="particuler" auto="true">particular</normalised> manner of the fits of this <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Elizabeth, you may imagine & <normalised orig="aime" auto="true">aim</normalised> at the manner of handling of the rest of her sisters, during this time, <normalised orig="remayning" auto="true">remaining</normalised> in other places, who were no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> <normalised orig="strangly" auto="true">strangely</normalised> dealt withal

than she was, of <normalised orig="whome" auto="true">whom</normalised> if it should be <normalised orig="particulerly" auto="true">particularly</normalised> be observed, as is done in her, just as strange wonders (if any thing <normalised orig="hetherto" auto="true">hitherto</normalised> <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> <normalised orig="strang" auto="true">strange</normalised>) befell every one of them severally, as are these, which you have already heard. And by some of them were <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> matters of <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> greater admiration but this may suffice, least in entrnig into the rest, no end could be found, so infinite is the matter.

It pleased the providence of God, that not long after <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Gilbert Pickering had <normalised orig="carryed" auto="true">carried</normalised> away this child to his house, about a <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised> or such a thing, the Lady Cromwell, wife of Sir Henry Cromwell, Knight, (who then lay in <normalised orig="Ramsey" auto="true">Ramsay</normalised>, a <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised> two <normalised orig="myles" auto="true">miles</normalised> distant from Warboyse) came to <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmortons house, together with her daughter in law, <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Cromwell, to <normalised orig="visite" auto="true">visit</normalised> these children & to comfort their parents, with who she was well acquainted: she had not long staid in the house, but the children which were there, fell all into their fits, & were so <normalised orig="grieuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> tormented for the time, y it <normalised orig="pittied" auto="true">pitied</normalised> that good Ladies hart to see them, in so much, that she could not <normalised orig="abstayn" auto="true">abstain</normalised> from <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised>, <normalised orig="wherupon" auto="true">whereupon</normalised>, she caused the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> woman, mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> to be sent for, who durst  not deny to come, because her husband was <normalised orig="tennant" auto="true">tenant</normalised> to Sir Henry Cromwell, who after she was come, y the children grew to be worse than they were before, which caused the greater <normalised orig="sorowe" auto="true">sorrow</normalised>. Then the Lady Cromwell <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> aside, and charged her deeply with this witchcraft, using also some hard speeches to her. But she strngly <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised> them all, saying, that <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Trockmorton and his wife did her great wrong, so to blame her without cause. The Lady <normalised orig="aunswered" auto="true">answered</normalised> her, that neither <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton nor his wife accused her, but the children themselves did it in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> fits did it, or rather the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> by them.

One of them, <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Ione by name, being then in her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, hearing the old woman thus clearing her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> (for she heard not the Lady nor any other) said, that it was she that caused all this, and something there is saith she, that <normalised orig="dooth" auto="true">doth</normalised> now tell me so: asking if no body heard it but she, <normalised orig="affyrming" auto="true">affirming</normalised> that it squealed very <normalised orig="loude" auto="true">loud</normalised> in her <normalised orig="eares" auto="true">ears</normalised>, & mervailed that no body could <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> it, wishing the old woman to listen to it. But mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> still continued her <normalised orig="denyal" auto="true">denial</normalised>. Then the Lady Cromwell would have taken her up into a chamber, to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> examined her more narrowly, (<normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Doctor Hall, a Doctor of divinity being present) but she by no means

would <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> with the, but rather <normalised orig="fayned" auto="true">feigned</normalised> many excuses to go home. In the end, when the Lady <normalised orig="perceiued" auto="true">perceived</normalised>, that by no good speeches, neither she, nor any other could <normalised orig="preuaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised> with her, & that fain she would have bin gone, she <normalised orig="suddainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> pulled of her kercher, & taking a <normalised orig="payre" auto="true">pair</normalised> of <normalised orig="sheeres" auto="true">shears</normalised>, clipped of a locke of her <normalised orig="haire" auto="true">hair</normalised>, & <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> it privily to <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Throckmorton, Mother of y children, together with her Hairlace, willing her to <normalised orig="burne" auto="true">burn</normalised> them. Mother Samuel <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised> her self thus dealt <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>, spake to the Lady thus. Madame why doe use me thus? I never did you any <normalised orig="harme" auto="true">harm</normalised> as yet.'  These words were afterwards <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised>, & were not at that present time taken hold of by any. Towards night the Lady departing, left the children much what as she found them.

The same night, after the Lady Cromwell departed fro Warboyse, she suffered many things in her dream concerning mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, & she was very <normalised orig="strangly" auto="true">strangely</normalised> tormented in her sleep, by a cat (as she imagined) which mother Samuel had sent unto her, which cat offered to pulcke of all the skin and flesh from her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> & body, but such was the <normalised orig="strugling" auto="true">struggling</normalised> and <normalised orig="striuing" auto="true">striving</normalised> of the Lady that night in her bed, & <normalised orig="mournfull" auto="true">mournfu</normalised> noise, which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> made speaking to the cat, and to mother Samuel that she wakened her bedfellow, who was <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Cromwell, before named, wife to the worshipfall <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Oliuer <normalised orig="Cromwel" auto="true">Cromwell</normalised>, <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> & <normalised orig="heyre" auto="true">heir</normalised> to <normalised orig="syr" auto="true">sir</normalised> Henry Cromwell, who that night was fro home. <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Cromwell being awakened, and <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised> y Lady thus disquieted, awakened her also, who greatly thanked her for it, declaring how she had bin troubled in her <normalised orig="dreame" auto="true">dream</normalised>, with mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> and her cat, with many other circumstances, which she did very well remember, neither could she take any quiet rest or sleep all that night after, for <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> <normalised orig="therof" auto="true">thereof</normalised>. Not long after, the Lady fell very <normalised orig="strangly" auto="true">strangely</normalised> sick, & so continued unto hey dying day, which was some <normalised orig="yere" auto="true">year</normalised> & quarter after her being at Warboyse.  The manner of her fits was much like the childrens, <normalised orig="saue" auto="true">save</normalised> <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> that she had <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> her perfect senses: for <normalised orig="somtime" auto="true">sometime</normalised> her <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> would be in one <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised>, sometime in the other: now in the one leg, by & by in the other, many times in her head: yea, <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> it would take her but in one <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> finger or toe, and <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> shake the <normalised orig="grieued" auto="true">grieved</normalised> part, as if it had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> the <normalised orig="palsey" auto="true">palsy</normalised>. And that saying of mother Samuel (which she used to her at Warboise, which was, Madam, I never hurt you as yet) would never

out of her mind. And thus <normalised orig="leauing" auto="true">leaving</normalised> this good Lady in heaven with God, we will <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> to these children.

About Christmas after, Anno 1590 (for there was nothing noted all y time, although there <normalised orig="befel" auto="true">befell</normalised> 100. wonders) <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Henry Pickering, uncle to these children, being then a <normalised orig="Scholler" auto="true">Scholar</normalised> of Cambridge, went to <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmortons house, & continued <normalised orig="ther" auto="true">there</normalised> some 3. or 4. <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised>, was desirous to speak with mother Samuel, & taking a convenient time, he requested 2. other <normalised orig="schollers" auto="true">scholars</normalised> of his acquaintance (then being in the town) to go with him, to who they granted, & presently went without the <normalised orig="knowledg" auto="true">knowledge</normalised> of any in <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmortons house. As they were going, she came out of her own house, & crossed y street before them: when they saw her, they determined rather to <normalised orig="folow" auto="true">follow</normalised> her whither she went, than stay her return, because her husband was a froward man, & wold not suffer her to <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> with any, if he might know it. She went to a neighbours house for some <normalised orig="Barme" auto="true">Barm</normalised>, & <normalised orig="caried" auto="true">carried</normalised> a little wooden tankard in her hand, & a little Barley in her lap, to exchange for the <normalised orig="Barme" auto="true">Barm</normalised>: when she came to the house, to whither she purposed to go, the <normalised orig="schollers" auto="true">scholars</normalised> followed her immediately, & heard her tel her errand to the wife of y house, who had not that for which she came. Being ready to depart, the <normalised orig="Schollers" auto="true">Scholars</normalised> desired to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> with her, but she seemed <normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> to stay, yet they <normalised orig="entring" auto="true">entering</normalised> into questions with her, <normalised orig="stayd" auto="true">stayed</normalised> her a little.  But she was very loud in her <normalised orig="answeres" auto="true">answers</normalised>, & impatient, not suffering any to speak, but her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, one of them desired her to keep the <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised>, & be more silent: she answered, that she was born in a mill, begot in a kill, she must have her will, she could speak no more softlier. The greatest part of her speech, was <normalised orig="rayling" auto="true">railing</normalised> words against Ma. Throckmorton & his children, saying, that he did misuse her, in suffering his children so to play the wantons in accusing of her, & bringing her name into question, often repeating, that the childrens fits was nothing but <normalised orig="wantonnesse" auto="true">wantonness</normalised> in them, & if they were her children, she <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> not suffer the so to escape without punishment, one after the other. The <normalised orig="schollers" auto="true">scholars</normalised> enquired about her <normalised orig="seruice" auto="true">service</normalised> of God, and profession of her faith. But al y they could get of her, was, that her God would deliver her, her God would defend her, and revenge her of her <normalised orig="enemie" auto="true">enemy</normalised>, <normalised orig="alway" auto="true">always</normalised> using the phrase of my God <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> doo this & that for me: which being noted by one of them, he asked her if she had a God, alone, or if she did not serve the same God that others did'? She <normalised orig="aunswered" auto="true">answered</normalised>, yes that she did: yet much <normalised orig="adoe" auto="true">ado</normalised> they had to bring her from the phrase of my God, to say the God of heaven & earth. In the end she would needs be gone, saying, that her husband would beat her for her long tarrying. Then the uncle of those children, being somewhat more moved than the rest, at the parting <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, that if she were the woman that had wrought this <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised> upon these children, the vengeance of God would surely wait upon her unto death, & howsoever she might deceive her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, & she <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> for a time, yet there was no way to <normalised orig="preuent" auto="true">prevent</normalised> the <normalised orig="iudgements" auto="true">judgements</normalised> of God, but by her confession & repentance: which if she did not in time, he hoped one day to see her burned at a stake, and he <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> would bring fire & wood, & the children should <normalised orig="blowe" auto="true">blow</normalised> the <normalised orig="coales" auto="true">coals</normalised>. Her <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> to him was this, (for they were then in the street hard by a pond) I had rather (<normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she) see you dowsed over head and <normalised orig="eares" auto="true">ears</normalised> in this pond, and so they parted.

Now to come to the point, the eldest of <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmortons daughters was then in her fit, sitting at home in a <normalised orig="Parlor" auto="true">Parlour</normalised>, her father and Grandmother, with some other of her sisters in their fits being present with her.  On the <normalised orig="suddaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> (said she) <normalised orig="nowe" auto="true">now</normalised> is my uncle (naming him) and the two other (whom also she named) going to mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>. We shall <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> some <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> by and by. Presently she <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> where mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> <normalised orig="goeth" auto="true">goes</normalised> trotting in the <normalised orig="streetes" auto="true">streets</normalised> before them, with a <normalised orig="woodden" auto="true">wooden</normalised> tankard in her hand, and her Apron is tucked up before her, I <normalised orig="belaeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised> she there is somewhat in it. She is gone into such a mans house that <normalised orig="keepeth" auto="true">keeps</normalised> an Alehouse, the mans name she could not hit of, but described him by his read head. Hark, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she

to her sisters, mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> is very <normalised orig="loude" auto="true">loud</normalised>, and my uncle bids her <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> softly, but she saith she cannot, repeating to her father and the rest, the same words, (viz. that she was borne in a mill, &c.) after the same manner that mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> spake them to her uncle, and the other <normalised orig="Schollers" auto="true">Scholars</normalised>. To bee short, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> declared <normalised orig="particulerly" auto="true">particularly</normalised> every <normalised orig="worde" auto="true">word</normalised> that passed <normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised> mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> and those <normalised orig="Schollers" auto="true">Scholars</normalised> at that time. And at the parting <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised>, there Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> my Uncle <normalised orig="dyd" auto="true">did</normalised> touch you I <normalised orig="thynke" auto="true">think</normalised>, repeating <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> the very same <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> that her Uncle had <normalised orig="doene" auto="true">done</normalised>, wishing that that day were once come, for I mys <normalised orig="elfe" auto="true">elf</normalised> (<normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> she) would
blow the <normalised orig="coales" auto="true">coals</normalised>.' But he had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> as good as if he had said nothing to her (said she) for she wished him over head & <normalised orig="eares" auto="true">ears</normalised> in the pond for it. Master Throckmorton standing by & hearing all this, after that the child had said, that now mother Samuel and the <normalised orig="schollers" auto="true">scholars</normalised> were parted, enquired of his brother, the <normalised orig="childs" auto="true">child's</normalised> uncle, asking if any one knew whither he was gone. Answer was made, that he had not came home fro the Church since evening Prayer, (for it was on a Saturday) but where he was no body knew. It may be (said <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton) that he is with mother Samue, & went <normalised orig="immediatly" auto="true">immediately</normalised> out of his own house, to see if he could <normalised orig="perceiue" auto="true">perceive</normalised> <normalised orig="wher" auto="true">where</normalised> they were. As he went he met them in the Church yard coming from mother Samuels. Where have you bin said he? They <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> him. I could have told you as much my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> he: & repeated to them the whole matter, as his daughter before had <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised>. When they were come into y <normalised orig="Parlor" auto="true">Parlour</normalised> where she was, there was also another of her sisters in her fit sitting by. And this her other sister could <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> her said uncle <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> unto her, & no body <normalised orig="els" auto="true">else</normalised>, and so by her mouth, (for they could for the most part <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> one another in their fits) he enquired of her sister all those matters over <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, which she did in his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> hearing repeat. But <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, the <normalised orig="winde" auto="true">wind</normalised> was so great that I had much <normalised orig="adoe" auto="true">ado</normalised> to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> them, whereas <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised> there was then no wind stirring. After this the spirit (or the thing, as the children called it) would many times <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> unto them in their fits in some <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of shape or other, but most commonly in the <normalised orig="likenes" auto="true">likeness</normalised> of a dun chicken, & would <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> familiarly with them, saying that they came from mother Samuel, (whom they called their dame) and were sent by her to the <normalised orig="chyldren" auto="true">children</normalised> to torment and <normalised orig="vexe" auto="true">vex</normalised> them in that sort. It would declare to the children many things concerning mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, insomuch that she <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> doo almost nothing at home for a great time, but the spirit <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> disclose, if it were required by the children in their fits: viz. asto know what she was then in doing at home, or in what place of her house, or <normalised orig="els" auto="true">else</normalised> where she was, the spirit would tell: which (by a Messenger presently sent of purpose) was <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> true.

Now the spirits manifestly began to accuse Mother Samuel to the children in their fits, saying: it was she that had bewitched them, and all those <normalised orig="seruants" auto="true">servants</normalised> which were bewitched in the house and told them, that whenever they were in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> fits, and were either <normalised orig="caried" auto="true">carried</normalised> to Mother Samuels house, or she caused to come to them, they should be presentl <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised>.  This many times was <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> true, & never failed once: so that if the children at any time being in theifts, had been <normalised orig="caried" auto="true">carried</normalised> to mother Samuels house, (for it was a very hard thing to get mother Samuel to Ma. Throckmortons house) althought they were in such a case, as y a strong man could scarcely hold them (they would so struggle, <normalised orig="starte" auto="true">start</normalised>, and <normalised orig="sprawle" auto="true">sprawl</normalised> in his <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>) yet if they came but once to the threshold of M. Samuels <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>, they would wipe their eyes, and say, I am <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised>, why doo you carry me, set me down, as though some shame had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> offered them, in that tehy were carried in the <normalised orig="streetes" auto="true">streets</normalised>, not knowing any thing in what case they had been.  While they <normalised orig="cotinued" auto="true">continued</normalised> in the house, they were very <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised>, but dtermining once to come away, and offering to come out of the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>, they <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> presently down on the <normalised orig="grounde" auto="true">ground</normalised>, & were brought from thence in the same case that they were carried thither: contrariwise, <normalised orig="whensoever" auto="true">whenever</normalised> Mo. Samuel came to Ma. Throckmortons house, in what kind of extremity soever these children were in, (as it was most wonderful strange to see them many times) so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as ever <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had set <normalised orig="foote" auto="true">foot</normalised> into the <normalised orig="Parler" auto="true">Parlour</normalised> or Hal where they were, they wold all presently start up upon their feet, and be as <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> as any in the house, and so continue while she was present.  But when she offered to depart, they would all <normalised orig="sinck" auto="true">sink</normalised> <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> as a stone upon the ground: if she turned but her face <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> & came towards them, they would be <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> as before, which was <normalised orig="tryed" auto="true">tried</normalised> rr. times in one <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised>.  And when she departed fro the house, she left them in the same estate <normalised orig="wherin" auto="true">wherein</normalised> she found them, so long as their fit continued upon them.  After this, Ma. Throckmorton thought good to disperse his <normalised orig="childre" auto="true">children</normalised>, & sent them abroad, some to one friends house, some to another for a time, to see how they <normalised orig="shold" auto="true">should</normalised> be dealt withal, yet <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> keeping some one of them at home with him.

If it <normalised orig="shold" auto="true">should</normalised> be declared how these were al <normalised orig="seuerally" auto="true">severally</normalised> handled for the time they were abroad, it would <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> a long discourse, & longer indeed the is thought meet at this time, <normalised orig="althogh" auto="true">although</normalised> very strange things, and such as may <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> worth the noting <normalised orig="befel" auto="true">befell</normalised> every one of them, as this for one: They could tell <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> in their fits, in what case or estate their other sisters were at that instant, being


<normalised orig="seperated" auto="true">separated</normalised> some of them 8. 10. or 12. miles a sunder, I have said, now is my sister, naming her & the place where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was in her fit very sore handled, as she <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised> also was at that instant.  It was <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> to be most true by the ijst computation of times, with many such like things.

But this may suffice concerning them being abroad, that they were <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> altogether <normalised orig="cleere" auto="true">clear</normalised> and free from their fits, although it be true that some of them, whither at home or <normalised orig="abroade" auto="true">abroad</normalised>, had not their fits <normalised orig="aboue" auto="true">above</normalised> once in a month, <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> once in <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> a <normalised orig="yeere" auto="true">year</normalised>, and one of them was <normalised orig="cleere" auto="true">clear</normalised> a whole <normalised orig="yeere" auto="true">year</normalised> together.  And this also is verified & true in some of these 5. sisters, that they were <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="cleere" auto="true">clear</normalised> nor free from some kind of fit or other, three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> together: I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> scarcely three <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> since the first day it <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> them, except now since these last Assizes in Lent, whereat these Witches were executed.

To <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> over all that which might be spoken of them for a <normalised orig="yeere" auto="true">year</normalised> and almost an <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised>, we will come <normalised orig="neerer" auto="true">nearer</normalised> unto these latter times, <normalised orig="wherin" auto="true">wherein</normalised> the spirits, whither <normalised orig="mooued" auto="true">moved</normalised> by their own malice, (as it <normalised orig="passeth" auto="true">passes</normalised> the reach of man to <normalised orig="sounde" auto="true">sound</normalised> the depth of the denils malice to mankind) or <normalised orig="mooued" auto="true">moved</normalised> by the malice of the senders, and letters on, or both: it is not <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised>, or whether for the conclusion and consummation of their parents patience in this <normalised orig="poynt" auto="true">point</normalised>: It pleased the <normalised orig="wisedom" auto="true">wisdom</normalised> of God, who in his providence had determined their end, to <normalised orig="graunt" auto="true">grant</normalised> them, <normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised> more liberty for the time, to exercise their malice against these children, we leave it to God, but truth it is, that they were more strangely vexed, & more <normalised orig="greiuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> tormented in their body now of late, & take them generally altogether, then at any time almost from the beginning.

And to <normalised orig="beginne" auto="true">begin</normalised> this time at Michelmasse last past, or thereabouts, <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> of these <normalised orig="chilldren" auto="true">children</normalised> were altogether at Warboyse, in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> Fathers house, and the <normalised orig="fift" auto="true">fifth</normalised>, which was the eldest of them, was at her <normalised orig="Unckles" auto="true">Uncles</normalised> house, Gilbert Pikering, Esquire, dwelling at Tichemarshe <normalised orig="groue" auto="true">grove</normalised>.

About this time, which was Michelmas 1592. one of these <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> children, the youngest save one, <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> upon the age of <normalised orig="fourteene" auto="true">fourteen</normalised> <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised>, was in a very strange kind of fit, the <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> <normalised orig="wherof" auto="true">whereof</normalised> was as <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>: Every day for the space of three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> or more, she had a <normalised orig="sencelesse" auto="true">senseless</normalised> <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, some one of the day or other,

and sometimes many fits in one day.  In which fit she could <normalised orig="neyther" auto="true">neither</normalised> <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>, see, nor speak to any body, besides, her inward griefs, that she would heave and start, and swell uppe her body, which was very troublesome to her for the time.  When she was out of these fits, she would <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> up & down the house very <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised>, she wold <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> & drink, and <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> be very pleasant in outward gesture with her sisters, she doo any thing, which by any <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> she did understand <normalised orig="shold" auto="true">should</normalised> be done, she wold make a <normalised orig="reuerence" auto="true">reverence</normalised> as she passed by, unto those where she saw it was due: in so much that any man ignorant of her estate, <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> <normalised orig="perceiue" auto="true">perceive</normalised> nothing to be <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised> in her, yet wold she <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> to any in <normalised orig="particuler" auto="true">particular</normalised>, <normalised orig="neyther" auto="true">neither</normalised> could she <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> any y spake to her during that time: except <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> she wold prattle a little to an infant, which was <normalised orig="newlie" auto="true">newly</normalised> borne in the house, wherein she <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> great delight.

It pleased God, about the beginning of these kind of fits in her, an <normalised orig="Aunte" auto="true">Aunt</normalised> of hers being then in y house, was <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> of a child, upon which occasion, many of her uncles & aunts and other kindred and friends, resorted to the house, and some of them <normalised orig="staied" auto="true">stayed</normalised> a week or ten <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> <normalised orig="togither" auto="true">together</normalised>, all which time the child was in these kide of fits: and as it happened, Ma. Samuel amongst the rest came to the house, and was brought up into the <normalised orig="gentlewomans" auto="true">gentlewoman's</normalised> chamber, where commonly the greatest company was: so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as she came in, (this <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> in question) <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> there, espied her, and presently spake to her, bidding her welcome, & saying that she was a great stranger there, she fetched her up both meat and drink, and wold do any thing readily that she willed her to do.  In the end, she asked Mo. Samuel, whose that little child was which she <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised> had in her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>? the old woman told her, and likewise the name of it, which thing she also <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised>: the <normalised orig="chylde" auto="true">child</normalised> mervailed, saying, Is my aunt then brought to bed? I am very glad of it: why then (saith she) such and such of mine, uncles and aunts promised to be <normalised orig="heere" auto="true">here</normalised>, who were then indeed in the house, and some of them in that company.  Then Mo. Samuel told her, that such & such whom she asked for, were in presence.  The child said, that she saw no body but her and that little child, which she had in her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, although she looked full in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> faces.  Many such like strange things the fell out, which is too long to speak of.  When the old woman departed, the child <normalised orig="loste" auto="true">lost</normalised> the use of all her

<normalised orig="sences" auto="true">senses</normalised>, and continued in the same case, <normalised orig="wherin" auto="true">wherein</normalised> she was when the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> woman came into the house.

When she had continued thus 3. <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> or more, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came one day out of her Aunts chamber into the hall, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had not long <normalised orig="staied" auto="true">stayed</normalised> there, but she <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> into a most troublesome <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised> for the time, but it continued not long, presently she spake and <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>: I am glad, and very glad, repeating it often, on the <normalised orig="suddaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> wiped her eyes, and came out of her fit.  Her mother being in the Hall, she asked her blessing, and enquired of many things, and amongst others, asked how her Aunt did, from whom a little before she came, and knew of nothing that was done, neither that any company had been there for the space of 2. <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> before.

It <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised> to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> of the rest of her sisters together with <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised>, [...] all of them, as the <normalised orig="yeere" auto="true">year</normalised> grew <normalised orig="towardes" auto="true">towards</normalised> an end, so their <normalised orig="griefes" auto="true">griefs</normalised> and extremity of troubles increased: insomuch, that every day brought with it increase of payne, and <normalised orig="strangenes" auto="true">strangeness</normalised> in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> manner of fits.

Towards Hollantide, the spirits grew very familiar with the children, and commonly towards the <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised> of their fits, when the greatest trouble was over, wold <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> with them, <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> together, & sometimes longer: The greatest matter of their talk, was about their <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of fits which they should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised>, & concerning Mo. Samuel, whose pleasure it was that they <normalised orig="shold" auto="true">should</normalised> be so used, but the spirits said many times, that they <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> bring her to shame for it in the end.  If in this time (<normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>) they had enquired of <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> <normalised orig="spyrite" auto="true">spirit</normalised>, when they should come out of that <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, <normalised orig="wherin" auto="true">wherein</normalised> then they were, and when they <normalised orig="sholde" auto="true">should</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> another, it would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> told them, and not missed any whit at all.

If they had asked how many <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> they should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> the next day following, and the third day, or any day that <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>, and how many fits they should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> in one day, and what <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> they should be, whither more <normalised orig="grieuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> or <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised>, howe long <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised> <normalised orig="shoulde" auto="true">should</normalised> continue, and in what <normalised orig="parte" auto="true">part</normalised> of the day they should <normalised orig="beginne" auto="true">begin</normalised>, and when they should <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised>, it hath <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> them, and not failed in any one <normalised orig="poynt" auto="true">point</normalised>, for it hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> presently <normalised orig="sette" auto="true">set</normalised> <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> in writing, as the <normalised orig="chyldren" auto="true">children</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> spoken it, (for it was not possible to remember the times for them all) and <normalised orig="prooued" auto="true">proved</normalised> wholly true.


The times and singes, which the spirits did appoint unto the, for the beginning or ending of their fits, were usually these.  In the morning so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as they did offer to arise out of <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> beds, so some as they were up or ready: so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as they asked <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> Father blessing, or <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> Mother, or <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> Grandmother: so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as they <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> a <normalised orig="hooke" auto="true">hook</normalised> in hand to pray, or when they had ended their prayers: so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as they went to <normalised orig="breakefast" auto="true">breakfast</normalised>, so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as Dinner was <normalised orig="sette" auto="true">set</normalised> <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the <normalised orig="boorde" auto="true">board</normalised>: or so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as they <normalised orig="dyd" auto="true">did</normalised> offer to say grace <normalised orig="eyther" auto="true">either</normalised> before or after dinner & so some as they <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised> were set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> to dinner, or at the first bit of <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> they put in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> <normalised orig="mouthes" auto="true">mouths</normalised>: or so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as dinner, was ended, or they had put up their <normalised orig="knyfe" auto="true">knife</normalised> after dinner: the same circumstances at Supper also observed.  Or if it had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the Sabboth day, or any day wherein the belles ought to be <normalised orig="runge" auto="true">rung</normalised>: so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as the first, second, or third <normalised orig="peale" auto="true">peal</normalised> ringeth, or <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> done ringing, with many such like <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised>, which <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> bee too long to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> of: <normalised orig="appoynted" auto="true">appointed</normalised> by the <normalised orig="spyrite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> for the children to fall in or out of <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, which they <normalised orig="duely" auto="true">duly</normalised> observed & failed not a <normalised orig="mynute" auto="true">minute</normalised>, as may be thought.

After they had continued in this case about a month together or such a thing, whether the spirits were <normalised orig="wearie" auto="true">weary</normalised>, (as they oftentimes <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> unto the children in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, that they now waxed weary of <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> Dame Mo. <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>) or whether y through the power of gods <normalised orig="goodnesse" auto="true">goodness</normalised>, and <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> protection of they <normalised orig="chyldren" auto="true">children</normalised>, the spirits <normalised orig="perceiued" auto="true">perceived</normalised>, that their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> malice, & the malice of their Dame to the children was restrained and kept under in such sort, that they could not kill the children as they desired: for wee may not <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised>, that it <normalised orig="agreeth" auto="true">agrees</normalised> with the nature of the <normalised orig="euil" auto="true">evil</normalised> <normalised orig="spyrite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> to sport and play with man, as these <normalised orig="spirites" auto="true">spirits</normalised> oftentimes did with these little children: they <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> to them, that <normalised orig="nowe" auto="true">now</normalised> ere long, they wold bring their Dame either to her confession or confusion.  And this was the greates stay of comfort & prop of patience which the parents of these <normalised orig="childre" auto="true">children</normalised> & <normalised orig="friendes" auto="true">friends</normalised> <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> had: namely, that when these children were in their greatest torment and miseries as might be devised, in such sort as that it made the hart of the beholders many times to met in their bodies, being without all hope <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> in this world to see them <normalised orig="aliue" auto="true">alive</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, yet <normalised orig="whensoeuer" auto="true">whenever</normalised> it pleased God to <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> them out of <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> fits, they

would wipe their eyes and bee presently well, as if it had <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> been they, not knowing any thing that had befallen them, so that now it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> that God <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> wold take the matter into his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> hands, & having in his <normalised orig="cousell" auto="true">counsel</normalised> determined an <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised> thereof, so he would also appoint the <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> to bring it to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised>, which was even by the spirits themselves, the instruments of this <normalised orig="wickednes" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>.  For now they began to accuse Mo. Samuel, openly to her face, & say y they <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> not be <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> in any place, excpe they continue in her house, or <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> be brought to continue <normalised orig="wyth" auto="true">with</normalised> them: and besides that, they <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> more troublesome <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> than ever they had, except one of those two be brought to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised>.

Mo. Throckmorton still thinking that the <normalised orig="spyrits" auto="true">spirits</normalised> might lye, was contended to try the uttermost to three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> togeher, all which time his children had very many most grievous and troublesome fits: insomuch that when night came, there was <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> a one of them able to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to their beds alone, their <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised> were so <normalised orig="ful" auto="true">full</normalised> of <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> and sores, besides many other <normalised orig="griefes" auto="true">griefs</normalised> they had in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> body (being out of their fits) which was not <normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised> with them: and one of them also for all that time of 3. <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised>, <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> had use of her legs, except it were an <normalised orig="howre" auto="true">hour</normalised> or two in one day, <normalised orig="whie" auto="true">why</normalised> Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> was in the house, and then she was able to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>, and was very well, as the rest also were: otherwise her legs were thrust uppe to her body as if they had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="tyed" auto="true">tied</normalised> with <normalised orig="stringes" auto="true">strings</normalised>, and where you <normalised orig="sette" auto="true">set</normalised> her <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, there you should <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> her, except she crept away.

<normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton, <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised> that by <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> could <normalised orig="gette" auto="true">get</normalised> <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> of old Iohn <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, for the old woman to come to his house, although he offered very largely for it, which was, to allow him if it came to ten pounds in the <normalised orig="yeere" auto="true">year</normalised> for the <normalised orig="boorde" auto="true">board</normalised> and wages, of the best <normalised orig="seruaunt" auto="true">servant</normalised> in Huntington-shyre to doo <normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="busines" auto="true">business</normalised> (if he would) in her stead, besides his promise & <normalised orig="bonde" auto="true">bond</normalised>, if he would require it, for the well using of his wife while <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was with him, he could <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> no other remedy for the health of <normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> children, but to carry them thither: which <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> did, who so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as they came into the house, were all presently <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised>, which he perceiuin, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, that his children should dwell there, & out of the house they should not <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>, he would <normalised orig="prouide" auto="true">provide</normalised> for <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> necessities.  The man seeing this, that there was no striving with

the company, quenched out of the fire, and it was a cold season, saying that he would <normalised orig="starue" auto="true">starve</normalised> them, besides very many <normalised orig="euill" auto="true">evil</normalised> words, which came from him and his daughter at that time.  All that day they continued there very <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised>, and did both <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> and <normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised>, and read in their <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>, and were very merry.  At night when the man Iohn Samuel <normalised orig="perceiued" auto="true">perceived</normalised> that they should lodge there, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> thought that they would be very troublesome to him, and therefore <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> his <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> promise, that his wife should come to Ma. Thorckmortons house the next morning, & continue with <normalised orig="hym" auto="true">him</normalised>: <normalised orig="wherupon" auto="true">whereupon</normalised> Ma. Throckmorton <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> home his children, & they were in their fits so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as they came out of his <normalised orig="doores" auto="true">doors</normalised>, and so continued all that night.  The next morning Ma. Thrackmorton went for the old woman, but she was gone no body <normalised orig="knewe" auto="true">knew</normalised> whither, so he sent <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> for his children, who so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as they came into the house, were <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised>.  Towards night, came in the old woman, who said that she had been 2. or 3. miles out of y town, and her husband know of her going, because she should not come to Ma. Throckmortons, which when he understood that she had spoken, (for she spake it <normalised orig="priuately" auto="true">privately</normalised>, desiring them to <normalised orig="whome" auto="true">whom</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> spake it, not to tell her husband) he utterly forswore the matter, and presently fell upon his wife, and <normalised orig="beate" auto="true">beat</normalised> her very sore with a <normalised orig="cudgell" auto="true">cudgel</normalised> many being present, before she could be rescued by them.  In the end, when the man <normalised orig="perceued" auto="true">perceived</normalised> Ma. Throckmorton <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised> to continue in the same mind aforesaid, he was contended to let his wife go home with the that night, who went all to Ma. Throckmortons house very <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> together, & so continued the space of nine or ten <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> following, without any <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of <normalised orig="sorenes" auto="true">soreness</normalised>, <normalised orig="lamenes" auto="true">lameness</normalised>, or any <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> grudging of fits, and in better care, then they had been (as it was <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised>) all of them together, for the space of three whole <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> before.  This made the parents right glad, and to use the woman as a welcome guest.  At the <normalised orig="tenne" auto="true">ten</normalised> <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> end, the old Woman <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Throckmorton, for her husband was gone forth that morning, that she might <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> home, making her excuse to fetch something that she wanted.  <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Throckmorton was very <normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> to grant it, promising that she her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> wold rather fetch what she would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised>, then that she shod <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> out of her house: yet the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> woman, saying that no <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> could come by that thing that she wold <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised>, but <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised> (which happily was true) and promising her present <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="yeelded" auto="true">yielded</normalised> to her request.

<normalised orig="Soone" auto="true">Soon</normalised> after <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was gone, some of the children fell into <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> fits <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> as before times, & the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> then talking with them, said.  That now Mo. Samuel was feeding her <normalised orig="spirites" auto="true">spirits</normalised>, & making a new league and composition with them, which was, that although now she came <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to the house, they <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> be no whit the better, but rather the worse for her being there, because <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would not <normalised orig="remaine" auto="true">remain</normalised> any longer there: which thing seemed to bee true that the <normalised orig="chyld" auto="true">child</normalised> spake, for so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as she came <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> (which was not before she was sent for 4. or 5. <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised> after she went) the children which were in their <normalised orig="fitts" auto="true">fits</normalised> at her <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised>, so continued, and they that were not after her <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised>, fell into their fits, all of them crying out that <normalised orig="nowe" auto="true">now</normalised> Mo. Samuel had made a <normalised orig="newe" auto="true">new</normalised> composition with her spirits, and now they should be no <normalised orig="whitte" auto="true">white</normalised> better for her presence, but rather the worse.

<normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton when he came home, and <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised> the case otherwise with his children then he left it, and the cause why, could not be but <normalised orig="hartily" auto="true">heartily</normalised> sorry: yet referred all to the good pleasure of GOD, and would not suffer the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> woman to depart his house, for this cause <normalised orig="chiefely" auto="true">chiefly</normalised>, because his children being in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> fits, could neither <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>, see, nor <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> to any body, but to her, & some of the <normalised orig="chidren" auto="true">children</normalised> could take nothing, but that which she <normalised orig="eyther" auto="true">either</normalised> <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> them, or touched with her hands.

Mother Samuel remaining thus with the children, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> not be in any place of the house alone, neither doing any thing about the house, but the children in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> <normalised orig="gits" auto="true">gets</normalised> wold <normalised orig="reveale" auto="true">reveal</normalised> it, specially when she was feeding of her <normalised orig="spyrits" auto="true">spirits</normalised>, for then the <normalised orig="chyldren" auto="true">children</normalised> would say: now is Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> in such a place of the house feeding of her <normalised orig="spyrits" auto="true">spirits</normalised>: when they went and looked, there they should <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> her, but whether <normalised orig="dooing" auto="true">doing</normalised> any such thing or not, God and her conscience are the best witnesses.

Many times also as she sate talking with these children, being in their fits by the fire side, they would say unto her: <normalised orig="Looke" auto="true">Look</normalised> you <normalised orig="heere" auto="true">here</normalised> Mo. Samuel, doo not you see this thing that <normalised orig="sitteth" auto="true">sits</normalised> <normalised orig="heere" auto="true">here</normalised> by us? she would <normalised orig="aunswere" auto="true">answer</normalised> no, not she: why they wold say <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, I <normalised orig="mervaile" auto="true">marvel</normalised> that you doo not see it, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> how it <normalised orig="leapeth" auto="true">leaps</normalised>, skyppeth, and <normalised orig="playeth" auto="true">plays</normalised> uppe and <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>: <normalised orig="poynting" auto="true">pointing</normalised> at it with their fingers


here & there as it leaped. <normalised orig="Somtimes" auto="true">Sometimes</normalised> also they would say, <normalised orig="Harke" auto="true">Hark</normalised> Mo. Samuel, how you not <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> it? <normalised orig="harke" auto="true">hark</normalised> how <normalised orig="loude" auto="true">loud</normalised> it is, I <normalised orig="mervaile" auto="true">marvel</normalised> you doo not <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> it, nay you cannot but <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> it.  She wold <normalised orig="denie" auto="true">deny</normalised> it, and bid them <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> their father, or some other whom she saw to stand by, whether they heard it or not.  The children wold <normalised orig="aunswer" auto="true">answer</normalised>, that they saw no body although thtey stood hard by the.  Then would they tell Mo. Samuel, that it <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> them, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> both <normalised orig="heareth" auto="true">hears</normalised> it, <normalised orig="seeth" auto="true">sees</normalised> it, and sent it.  The father these <normalised orig="childre" auto="true">children</normalised>, Ma. Throckmorton, to make a kind of experience of this matter, one night willed Mo. Samuel, that it <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> them, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> both <normalised orig="heareth" auto="true">hears</normalised> it, <normalised orig="seeth" auto="true">sees</normalised> it, and sent it.  The father of these <normalised orig="childre" auto="true">children</normalised>, Ma. Throckmorton, to make a kind of experience of this matter, one night willed Mo. <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> (as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> might have <normalised orig="doone" auto="true">done</normalised> to any other then <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> present) to name howe many <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> those three children that then were in their fits, <normalised orig="shoulde" auto="true">should</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> the next day following, and what kind of fits they <normalised orig="shold" auto="true">should</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised>, when they should being, and how long they should continue.  Mo. Samuel, was very <normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> to be brought unto it: yet in the end, <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> father saying that she should doe it.  <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, one of them shall aue three <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, naming the child, such & such for the manner, namely <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, appointing the time for their beginnings and endings: th eother shall <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> none, but be well all the day.  All which fits, <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> very instly in <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> one of them the next day, as she had spoken.

At an other time not long after, Mo. Samuel sitting by these <normalised orig="chyldren" auto="true">children</normalised> <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> in their <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> as before, Ma. Throckmorton <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> father, and some other also being with him, <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> of Mo. <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, saying, that he had heard, that those that were acquainted with these spirits (as the children say that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is) and had retained them in their <normalised orig="seruice" auto="true">service</normalised>, to doo for them as they <normalised orig="commaunded" auto="true">commanded</normalised>, that they did <normalised orig="feede" auto="true">feed</normalised> them, and reward them with some thing from them, but most usually with their <normalised orig="bloode" auto="true">blood</normalised>, and that <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> day: now therefore (said he) make open confession, & shame the devil in telling the truth, whether you doo any such thing or not.

<normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> most vehemently denied it, with many bitter words and curses upon her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, desiring the Lord, to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> some present token from heaven upon her, that all the world might <normalised orig="knowe" auto="true">know</normalised>, that she was such a kind of woman, as they suspected her for, if she used any such thing, or rewarded them any such way, or had any spirits, or knew what they were.

Presently after, <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton, and <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Henry Pickering, uncle to the said <normalised orig="childre" auto="true">children</normalised>, who was then with him, hearing her use such protestations, being half terrified in her harts, (because they <normalised orig="alway" auto="true">always</normalised> vehemently suspected her giltinesse) that she <normalised orig="shoulde" auto="true">should</normalised> thus violently with her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised> (as it were) pull <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> the <normalised orig="iudgments" auto="true">judgments</normalised> of God <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her head, went out of the <normalised orig="doores" auto="true">doors</normalised>, and before they were gone ten paces from the house, another young Gentleman, <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Iohn Lawrence (cozen to the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> children) that stayed <normalised orig="behinde" auto="true">behind</normalised> in the <normalised orig="Parlor" auto="true">Parlour</normalised>, came to <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton, and Ma: Henry Pickering, & <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> that mother Samuels chin did <normalised orig="bleede" auto="true">bleed</normalised>: whereupon they returned into the <normalised orig="Parlor" auto="true">Parlour</normalised> <normalised orig="agayn" auto="true">again</normalised> where she was, and <normalised orig="sawe" auto="true">saw</normalised> the napkin where with <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had wiped away the blood from her chin, to be bloody to the <normalised orig="quantitie" auto="true">quantity</normalised> of eight or ten drops.  Then Ma. Throckmorton, with the rest looked <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her <normalised orig="chinne" auto="true">chin</normalised>, and there was no more to be <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> than upon the back of a <normalised orig="cleane" auto="true">clean</normalised> <normalised orig="hande" auto="true">hand</normalised>, <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> there appeared some <normalised orig="fewe" auto="true">few</normalised> little red spots, as if they had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> flea-bytings.  Then <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> of her, whether her chin used to <normalised orig="bleede" auto="true">bleed</normalised> so or not: She <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, that it did very often.  He asked her, who <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> <normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> it but her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>?  She <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> no <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>, for it did <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> bleed when she was alone, and she <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> any body of it.

This her bleeding at the <normalised orig="chinne" auto="true">chin</normalised>, she did <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> to the <normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Henry Pickering, after <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was condemned, that the <normalised orig="spirites" auto="true">spirits</normalised> were then sucking at her <normalised orig="chinne" auto="true">chin</normalised>, when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> made that protestation to <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton and him, and that when she <normalised orig="wyped" auto="true">wiped</normalised> them of with her hand, her <normalised orig="chinne" auto="true">chin</normalised> bled, which sometimes it had done before, after their sucking, but not often, and <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> so much as then, nay scarcely the <normalised orig="quantitie" auto="true">quantity</normalised> of one drop at any time before.

And <normalised orig="thys" auto="true">this</normalised> by the way, as a <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> note throughout the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised>, where there is one of these <normalised orig="straunge" auto="true">strange</normalised> <normalised orig="thinges" auto="true">things</normalised> set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> (if they bee so accounted as <normalised orig="straunge" auto="true">strange</normalised>) there are ten omitted, which may as well bee put in, and (in the <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> of them that <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> of them) are no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> <normalised orig="straunge" auto="true">strange</normalised> than these: And for that which this <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> <normalised orig="dooth" auto="true">doth</normalised> <normalised orig="contayne" auto="true">contain</normalised>, it is set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the <normalised orig="suddayne" auto="true">sudden</normalised>, and as it <normalised orig="commeth" auto="true">comes</normalised> to present <normalised orig="memorie" auto="true">memory</normalised>, at the request of

of <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> Right <normalised orig="Worshipfull" auto="true">Worshipful</normalised>, and especially for the motion sake of the Right Worshpfull, <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Justice Fenner, one of the Patrons <normalised orig="heereof" auto="true">hereof</normalised>.  And for the <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised> of the most of these <normalised orig="thinges" auto="true">things</normalised> herein <normalised orig="contayned" auto="true">contained</normalised>, they were <normalised orig="gyuen" auto="true">given</normalised> in evidence, and ready to bee given <normalised orig="agaynst" auto="true">against</normalised> the <normalised orig="partyes" auto="true">parties</normalised> accused, if <normalised orig="eyther" auto="true">either</normalised> <normalised orig="neede" auto="true">need</normalised> should have required or time <normalised orig="serued" auto="true">served</normalised>, <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the <normalised orig="oathe" auto="true">oath</normalised> of <normalised orig="dyuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> Gentlemen on the Assizes day at Huntington, before the <normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised> parties: And for the rest which were not then <normalised orig="alleadged" auto="true">alleged</normalised>, if any shall made doubt thereof, there are <normalised orig="dyuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> Gentleman, of honest report, ready to <normalised orig="confyrme" auto="true">confirm</normalised> the same auppon <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> <normalised orig="oathes" auto="true">oaths</normalised>, if <normalised orig="neede" auto="true">need</normalised> <normalised orig="shoulde" auto="true">should</normalised> so require, that were present, some at one <normalised orig="tyme" auto="true">time</normalised>, and some at another, at all these <normalised orig="seuerall" auto="true">several</normalised> Tragedies, (as they may be <normalised orig="tearmed" auto="true">termed</normalised>.)

At another time, <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> after, the <normalised orig="spirites" auto="true">spirits</normalised> <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> the children (then being in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> fits, the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> woman also standing by them) that if <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> Father <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> then presently <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to Iohn Samuells house, his daughter Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, who then dwelt at home with her father, and is not yet brought into question about any of these matters, <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> hide her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, and not be <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> of him.  <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton hearing them, said, that he would <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> presently and make <normalised orig="tryall" auto="true">trial</normalised> thereof.  When he came to the house, Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, whether <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised> Ma: Throckmorton, or any of his company, or what so ever <normalised orig="els" auto="true">else</normalised> it was, it is not <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised>, but she went up into the Chamber (there being but one in the house) she stayres <normalised orig="wherof" auto="true">whereof</normalised> <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> in the same <normalised orig="Parlor" auto="true">Parlour</normalised> <normalised orig="belowe" auto="true">below</normalised> where her father was, and the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> <normalised orig="therof" auto="true">thereof</normalised> was a trappe <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>: where-upon <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> set sackes of <normalised orig="corne" auto="true">corn</normalised>, and <normalised orig="tubbes" auto="true">tubbs</normalised> with some such like things, to <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> it <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>.  <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton hearing a <normalised orig="noyse" auto="true">noise</normalised> in the house throught there was some such matter in hand, & continued still knocking at the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>.  Presently Iohn <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> asked who was there, and what he would, with some such <normalised orig="lyke" auto="true">like</normalised> questions, and in the <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised>, knowing what he was, <normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="shoulde" auto="true">should</normalised> not come in; Then <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton when on the other side of the house, and finding the back <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> open, went in, and when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> came into the <normalised orig="Parlor" auto="true">Parlour</normalised> where the man was in <normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="bedde" auto="true">bed</normalised>, <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> about eight of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> or something before, he asked for Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, his daughter, and where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was, Iohn <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> had not <normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="oathe" auto="true">oath</normalised> to <normalised orig="seeke" auto="true">seek</normalised>, 

but presently swore as God <normalised orig="iudge" auto="true">judge</normalised> his <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> (which was <normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> common oath, and used also divers times before the <normalised orig="Benche" auto="true">Bench</normalised> at his <normalised orig="arraignement" auto="true">arraignment</normalised>, yea, and until the very time of his execution) that he knew not where she was. 

Ma. Throckmorton asked when he saw her? He <normalised orig="aunswered" auto="true">answered</normalised>, that since the evening she was in the house, but where now <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is, he could not tell.  He asked if she was not in the chamber <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> them, he swore he could not tel, which thing he could not (indeed) but know, for it was a very low chamber, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> not <normalised orig="sturre" auto="true">stir</normalised> her <normalised orig="foote" auto="true">foot</normalised> in it, but he must <normalised orig="needes" auto="true">needs</normalised> <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> her: besides, her going up into it, for the stayres stood hard at his beds <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised>, and the <normalised orig="noyse" auto="true">noise</normalised> also <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> made in the hearing of Ma. Throckmorton and the rest <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> into the house.  Ma. Throckmorton <normalised orig="verely" auto="true">verily</normalised> suspecting that she was there, called to her three or 4. times and willed her to <normalised orig="aunswer" auto="true">answer</normalised> if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was there, for it was all that he desired, to know where she was, but she would not answer: Then Ma. Throckmorton <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> the candle, and said he <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> up and see, but when he came to the <normalised orig="toppe" auto="true">top</normalised> of the <normalised orig="staires" auto="true">stairs</normalised>, the trap <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> was so fast, that he could not <normalised orig="sturre" auto="true">stir</normalised> it, which he <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised>, said, that surely eh wold break open the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>, or <normalised orig="breake" auto="true">break</normalised> up the plancher of the chamber, for he <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> into it before he went out of the house, and willed one of the company to fetch him a <normalised orig="barre" auto="true">bar</normalised> of <normalised orig="yron" auto="true">iron</normalised> or some such like thing, for <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would doe it <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised>.

The <normalised orig="Maide" auto="true">Maid</normalised> hearing Ma. Throckmorton thus resolute, <normalised orig="aunswered" auto="true">answered</normalised> that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was there: then Ma. Throckmorton willed her to come <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>: which she did, remooving those <normalised orig="thinges" auto="true">things</normalised> that before <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had set <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>, so <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> departed home to his house, challenging the man for his naughty lye, which yet hes  stiflie stood in.  But to let an hundred of these things <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> with their <normalised orig="fellowes" auto="true">fellows</normalised>, and to come <normalised orig="neerer" auto="true">nearer</normalised> the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> confession, and the <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of it: you shall understand, that mother Samuel grew now to be mervailous weary of <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmortons house, both because <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> doo nothing in the house, but the <normalised orig="chyldren" auto="true">children</normalised> in their fits would <normalised orig="reueale" auto="true">reveal</normalised> it, and especially, because the children in their fits, likewise had told her twenty times, to her face, that she <normalised orig="shold" auto="true">should</normalised> <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> this matter before the Tuesday after Twelve day, and that the spirits had told them, that they would


enforce her to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it in <normalised orig="despight" auto="true">despite</normalised> of her, and she had often experience, that whatsoever the spirits foretold, <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> most true.

Now this Tuesday which the children so often named, was not then thought upon (of any that heard it) to be the Sessions day at Huntington, as it is generally in most places of England, no not within a <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> or more after the children had spoken of it: yet were they often whispering with themselves (<normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> as you must <normalised orig="understande" auto="true">understand</normalised> it) about that Tuesday, wishing oftentimes, that it were once come, for y was some happy day (they would say) belike for them, for after that day the spirits had told them, they should <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> have <normalised orig="moe" auto="true">more</normalised> <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> : so that all <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> <normalised orig="ioy" auto="true">joy</normalised> in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, was for that day, yet they would say to <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised>, that the spirits doth tell them, that it may happily be before that Tuesday: but on y Tuesday at the farthest <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> must <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it, and they must be well, but if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it before, they should be well prsently <normalised orig="whensoeuer" auto="true">whenever</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it.

For <normalised orig="thys" auto="true">this</normalised> cause the children in their fits continually <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> exhort her to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it, <normalised orig="tha" auto="true">that</normalised> they might be well, which yet <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> would <normalised orig="denie" auto="true">deny</normalised> to doo, saying: that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> wold not <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> that which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> did know of, nor consented unto: the children would <normalised orig="aunswere" auto="true">answer</normalised>, that they <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> not <normalised orig="wishe" auto="true">wish</normalised> her to accuse <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised> for any thing, and therefore willed her to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> ot that in any respect, yet they said, that they enforced no more upon her, then what the spirits had told them.  Yet to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> the <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised> of these <normalised orig="chyldren" auto="true">children</normalised> and no more, if any thing <normalised orig="heerein" auto="true">herein</normalised> written of them be strange, <normalised orig="thys" auto="true">this</normalised> for <normalised orig="strangenesse" auto="true">strangeness</normalised> <normalised orig="goeth" auto="true">goes</normalised> beyond all other, and for <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised> <normalised orig="equall" auto="true">equal</normalised> to the rest: such were the <normalised orig="heuenly" auto="true">heavenly</normalised> & <normalised orig="devine" auto="true">divine</normalised> speeches of these children in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> fits, to this <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> woman, some at one time, some at another, concerning her confession of thy fact, as that if a man had heard it, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> not <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> thought <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> better edified at <normalised orig="tenne" auto="true">ten</normalised> Sermons.

The matter of <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> speech was <normalised orig="thys" auto="true">this</normalised>, concerning chiefly the <normalised orig="ioyes" auto="true">joys</normalised> of heaven which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> should loose: and the torments of <normalised orig="hel" auto="true">hell</normalised> which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="shoulde" auto="true">should</normalised> endure, if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> guilty <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> not yet <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>, and the eschewing of the one and <normalised orig="enioying" auto="true">enjoying</normalised> of the other, if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> and be sorry for that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had <normalised orig="doone" auto="true">done</normalised>: they rehearsed likewise unto her, her naughty manner of <normalised orig="lyuing" auto="true">living</normalised>, her

<normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised> cursing and banning of all that displeased her, and especially of their parents, and of them: (which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> not deny) her negligent <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> to Church, and <normalised orig="slacknesse" auto="true">slackness</normalised> in Gods <normalised orig="seruice" auto="true">service</normalised>, all which she confessed to them, but she <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> now begin to ammende she said, Her <normalised orig="leude" auto="true">lewd</normalised> bringing up of her Daughter, in suffering her to her Dame, both in <normalised orig="controwling" auto="true">controlling</normalised> of her, and beating of her, which before had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> proved to her face, & <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised> had also confessed.  They <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised> also unto her, that which they had heard some speak of, <normalised orig="whe" auto="true">when</normalised> they were out of their <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>: namely, that she had said, that their fits were but <normalised orig="wantonnesse" auto="true">wantonness</normalised> in them: they asked her now, whether she was still of that <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> or not: <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> <normalised orig="aunswered" auto="true">answered</normalised> no: with many such like speeches, and in the <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised>, concluded with their <normalised orig="harty" auto="true">hearty</normalised> prayer to God for her, saying that they <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> forgive her from <normalised orig="bottome" auto="true">bottom</normalised> of their hart, if she wold <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it that they might be <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised>, besides that, that they <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="intreate" auto="true">entreat</normalised> <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> parents and <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> <normalised orig="friendes" auto="true">friends</normalised> (so much as in them lay) <normalised orig="cleerely" auto="true">clearly</normalised> to <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised> and forget all that was past.  Their <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of <normalised orig="behauior" auto="true">behaviour</normalised> in this their exhortation to her was, that as for the most part they <normalised orig="beganne" auto="true">began</normalised> <normalised orig="wyth" auto="true">with</normalised> <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised>, so they continued, and <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> ended with <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised>: insomuch that there was not any y heard them, could <normalised orig="abstaine" auto="true">abstain</normalised> fro weeping, <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> the old woman was little or nothing <normalised orig="mooved" auto="true">moved</normalised>.

This <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of <normalised orig="behavior" auto="true">behaviour</normalised> in the children, passed or <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> <normalised orig="neerer" auto="true">nearer</normalised> Christmas, yet without any touch or <normalised orig="sturring" auto="true">stirring</normalised> of the old woman, in the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> season every day almost, this old woman had a fit of bleeding at the nose, and bled very much at a time (which is not <normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised> in old age) so that now she wared <normalised orig="fainte" auto="true">faint</normalised>, and looked very pale, insomuch, that <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton and his wife, were very careful for her, fearing some <normalised orig="harme" auto="true">harm</normalised> should come unto her in his house: and comforted her by all the <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> they could, not suffereing her to want any thing that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> desired, if possibly they could come by it: so that she <normalised orig="dyd" auto="true">did</normalised> <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> to all that came to her, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was mervailous well used of <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton, and thought <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised> greatly <normalised orig="bounde" auto="true">bound</normalised> to him, as <normalised orig="truely" auto="true">truly</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had no other cause.

For as for her <normalised orig="businesse" auto="true">business</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="dyd" auto="true">did</normalised> nothing, but her own work, and for her <normalised orig="dyet" auto="true">diet</normalised>, she sat at his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="boorde" auto="true">board</normalised>, or with his children, if they were in their fits, and <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> not sit <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, and for her


lodging <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> lay continually in his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> Chamber and for the most part with one of his children.

And to tell you one thing more of her before her confession, one of <normalised orig="thse" auto="true">thee</normalised> Children, <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Elizabeth Throckmorton, was one day not well at ease, and <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> not <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> any <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised>: yet when night came and supper was ready, she thought to make her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> <normalised orig="amendes" auto="true">amends</normalised>: but when she was ready to <normalised orig="sitte" auto="true">sit</normalised> at the Table, she fell presently into her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, and yet that was not all the punishment she had, but her mouth was locked uppe, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> neither <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised>, <normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised>, nor <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, as it was an <normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised> thing with them all, to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> <normalised orig="mouthes" auto="true">mouths</normalised> shut uppe, especially at <normalised orig="meale" auto="true">meal</normalised> <normalised orig="tymes" auto="true">times</normalised>, and other <normalised orig="whyles" auto="true">while</normalised> <normalised orig="shutte" auto="true">shut</normalised> and open, <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> a dozen <normalised orig="tymes" auto="true">times</normalised> in a dinner, so <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> the <normalised orig="spirites" auto="true">spirits</normalised> <normalised orig="sporte" auto="true">sport</normalised> with them: but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> went so to <normalised orig="bedde" auto="true">bed</normalised>, very <normalised orig="sorowfull" auto="true">sorrowful</normalised> and weeping, what her <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> was, none can tell, because she was not able to utter it: when the next day came, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> and ill, as the day before, (yet out of her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>) and <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> very little or nothing at all, when night came she <normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> felt her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> well amended, and very hungry: not knowing for her part, but that she had eaten her supper the night before.

Then was <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="councelled" auto="true">counselled</normalised> by them that feared the worst, to <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> something, but she <normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised> she <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> not, purposing to <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> her part at supper, when the time came, and <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> was set upon the <normalised orig="boorde" auto="true">board</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> fell into the same case as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> in the night before, which <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised>, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised> to the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> woman that <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> by her.  I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> (Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>) you are disposed to <normalised orig="pyne" auto="true">pine</normalised> that <normalised orig="wenche" auto="true">wench</normalised>.  She made <normalised orig="hym" auto="true">him</normalised> <normalised orig="aunswere" auto="true">answer</normalised> no, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was rather sorry to see it.  Well <normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised>, surely you shall <normalised orig="neyther" auto="true">neither</normalised> <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> nor <normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised>, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> canne doo both, and therefore (<normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton) <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> fasteth, you shall fast, and when she can <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised>, you shall <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised>, but not before, use the matter as you will.  And thus they continued both fasting, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> Supper was almost ended, and the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> ready to <normalised orig="arrise" auto="true">arise</normalised>: the one fasting <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> <normalised orig="necessitie" auto="true">necessity</normalised>, because she could not <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised>, and the other for <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmortons pleasure, because she might not.

The <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> woman perceiuning that Ma. Throckmorton was in good earnest with her, & that the meat was <normalised orig="caried" auto="true">carried</normalised> out of y <normalised orig="Parlor" auto="true">Parlour</normalised>: On

On the <normalised orig="suddaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised>, upon what motion GOD <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised>, the child fetched a great sigh, for she had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> weeping all Supper time, and spake, saying, If I had some <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> now, I could <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> it.

<normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Throckmorton (the childes Mother) hearing her <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, as did also all the rest that were in the <normalised orig="Parlor" auto="true">Parlour</normalised>, commanded presently that <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> should be <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> to them both, the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> not <normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> notice to Mother Samuel of the <normalised orig="mater" auto="true">matter</normalised>: so they both fell to themeate very <normalised orig="hartily" auto="true">heartily</normalised>, but especially the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> Woman, who as it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised>, was then very hungry, (as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> a good <normalised orig="stomacke" auto="true">stomach</normalised>) and from that time <normalised orig="forwardes" auto="true">forwards</normalised>, during the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> continuing in the house, neither that child, nor any of her sisters, had their <normalised orig="mouthes" auto="true">mouths</normalised> shut up, at <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> time when they <normalised orig="shoulde" auto="true">should</normalised> <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> their <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised>, or if they were, they did not long continue so.  Although it was a common <normalised orig="custome" auto="true">custom</normalised> with them before time, to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> gone <normalised orig="supperlesse" auto="true">supperless</normalised> to bed upon that very occasion, many a time.

After all these matters were passed over, and as it wared <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> day <normalised orig="neerer" auto="true">nearer</normalised> and <normalised orig="neerer" auto="true">nearer</normalised> to the time appointed, Mo. Samuel <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> day complained of a new <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> to befall her, sometimes she would cry out of her <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>, that it was so full of <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised>, that she was not able to <normalised orig="sturre" auto="true">stir</normalised> <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised> in her <normalised orig="bedde" auto="true">bed</normalised> all the day long, nor take any rest at night.

Sometimes she would in like <normalised orig="sorte" auto="true">sort</normalised> cry out of her head, otherwhiles of her <normalised orig="stomacke" auto="true">stomach</normalised>: yet <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> her <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised>, saying that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had a gnawing at her hart, and the next day after, it would be in her knee, or lower, so that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> halting up and <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> the house.  And to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> the <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised> of her, it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> that something there was that troubled her, <normalised orig="whatsoeuer" auto="true">whatsoever</normalised> it was, for she would so <normalised orig="grone" auto="true">groan</normalised>, and <normalised orig="mone" auto="true">moan</normalised> <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised> in the <normalised orig="nyght" auto="true">night</normalised> time, one while <normalised orig="complayning" auto="true">complaining</normalised> of this <normalised orig="parte" auto="true">part</normalised> of her <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>, another while of that, that <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> rested but little in the night <normalised orig="tyme" auto="true">time</normalised> <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised>, and greatly disquieted those also that lay in the Chamber by her.

And one night amongst all the rest, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> out <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised> of her <normalised orig="bellie" auto="true">belly</normalised>, insomuch, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> disturbed and awakened both Ma. Throckmorton and his wife, that lay by her, saith <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throckmorton.  In Gods name Mo. Samuel, what <normalised orig="aileth" auto="true">ails</normalised> you and why do you <normalised orig="grone" auto="true">groan</normalised> so? said she, I have a marvellous great <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> in my belly on the <normalised orig="suddaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised>, and I know not how it should be caused.  Why said he, what is the matter in your belly?  She answered, that there was <normalised orig="somthing" auto="true">something</normalised> in it, which as she thought stirred, and it was as big as a penny <normalised orig="loafe" auto="true">loaf</normalised>: and put her to <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised>: <normalised orig="wherupon" auto="true">whereupon</normalised> <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Throgmorton arose out of her bed, and went and felt upon her belly, and there was indeed a <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> swelling to the <normalised orig="quantitie" auto="true">quantity</normalised> before likened, but she felt it not <normalised orig="stirre" auto="true">stir</normalised>, not staying long with her, the weather was so cold, and be it spoken without offence to women, it may be that she bred then that <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, <normalised orig="wherewithall" auto="true">wherewithal</normalised> she said she was when she was asked what she could say (by my Lord the Judge, why sentence of death should not be <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> against her,) as hereafter you shall <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>.  But <normalised orig="whatsoeuer" auto="true">whatsoever</normalised> it was, she cried out to P. Throgmorton of her belly, and said she was full of pain, and further she said, that she had often told him, that she thought there was <normalised orig="euill" auto="true">evil</normalised> spirits <normalised orig="hanted" auto="true">hinted</normalised> his house, which did thus torment his children, which thing he told her that he did easily <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> was true, and now saith she, I <normalised orig="verely" auto="true">verily</normalised> <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised>, that one of them is gotten into my belly.  <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throgmorton <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, that all this might <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> well be true.  So she said,, that it was an <normalised orig="euil" auto="true">evil</normalised> house, and haunted with spirits, and wished that she had <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> come into it: he told her that if there were <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> <normalised orig="euill" auto="true">evil</normalised> spirits haunted the house, they were of her sending, and so he would grant all that she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>.  In the end she passed away that night with groaning and <normalised orig="moning" auto="true">moaning</normalised>, and the next morning she was <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="euill" auto="true">evil</normalised> at ease she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, but her swelling in her belly was gone, and where her greatest <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> was she could not tell, it was in so many places, but her <normalised orig="stomacke" auto="true">stomach</normalised> was the best of any other part, and after this she continually complained of one part of her <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> or other, so long as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> stayed in the house.

Within a <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> short time after, one of the children fell into a most terrible <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised> mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> standing by, and it was so <normalised orig="greeuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her for the time, as that neither <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> nor <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> of her sisters, had the <normalised orig="lyke" auto="true">like</normalised> for the space of a <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> or two before, and especially her neesing fit was so terrible and strong <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her as if it would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> caused

her eyes to start out of her head.  This fit did greatly <normalised orig="quayle" auto="true">quail</normalised> mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, for <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> did then <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised>, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> dyed at that present, and this <normalised orig="wroong" auto="true">wrong</normalised> out of mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> prayers : so that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> desrired the Lord then to <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> her, and to <normalised orig="preserue" auto="true">preserve</normalised> her in that danger, and she hoped <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> to see her in the like <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>.  But the more earnest mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> was in her prayers, the greater was the childes trouble and torment, and the oftener she named God, or Jesus Christ, the stronger the childes fit was <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her.  And at that <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> instant (as hereafter you shall <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> of the rest) when she had thus continued some two <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised> or more, the spirit spake unto the child and said, that there was a worse fit then this to come yet, wherein she must be worse handled then thus, the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> answered, that she cared neither for him nor his dame, but willed them to do their worst they could to her, for (she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>) she hoped God would <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> her, and <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> after she came <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> of her fit and was <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> well; but the sight of this fit was so terrible to mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would many times pray that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> might <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> see the <normalised orig="lyke" auto="true">like</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> in <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> of them.

The children continued still all of them calling <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> to make confession of this matter, saying that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> must do it before it be long.  And as good at first as at last, but if she would now do it, that they might be well before Christmas, they would then <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> themselves beholding to her.  They told her further, that now Christmas was at hand, and if she would now <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it; then should be presently well, and <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> (by the grace of God ) a <normalised orig="merrie" auto="true">merry</normalised> Christmas.  She answered that she would do for them all the good she could, but for confession of this matter, she would not, for it was a thing she <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> knew of, nor consented unto.  Their father <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton, hearing his children and the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> woman thus <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> <normalised orig="togither" auto="true">together</normalised>, stepped in and <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, Mother Samuel you <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> what these children say, which is, that if you would <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> this fact, they should be presently well, and they say that you must <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it before it be long, and you know that they <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> not used to tell <normalised orig="lyes" auto="true">lies</normalised> in their fits.  Now therefore in the name of God, if there be <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> such matter, <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it: it is

<normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> too late to repent, and to <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> for <normalised orig="mercie" auto="true">mercy</normalised>: but she made to him the like <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> that she had done to the children before.  Then said he, but what say you to that <normalised orig="greeuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> fit which the spirit of late <normalised orig="threatned" auto="true">threatened</normalised> to my daughter Iane, I would fain know when that should be, Oh saith she (<normalised orig="remembring" auto="true">remembering</normalised> the terror of it) I trust in God I shall <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> see her in such a case again; nor any of them all.  Yes saith <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton, I <normalised orig="verely" auto="true">verily</normalised> <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> she shall <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> it, and that shortly, for the spirit you know <normalised orig="useth" auto="true">uses</normalised> not to <normalised orig="faile" auto="true">fail</normalised> them in any thing he <normalised orig="promiseth" auto="true">promises</normalised>, Oh (saith she) I trust in God she shall <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> it, speaking <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> confidently.  Why saith M. Throg. charge the spirit in the name of God, y she may escape this fit which is <normalised orig="threatned" auto="true">threatened</normalised>.  She <normalised orig="presetly" auto="true">presently</normalised> said, I charge thee spirit in the name of God, that <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Iane <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> this fit.  The child sitting by said, truly the thing saith, I <normalised orig="thanke" auto="true">thank</normalised> God, that I <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> this fit, that he hath foretold me of. Saith <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton, why, that is well, <normalised orig="thankes" auto="true">thanks</normalised> be to God, go on mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, and charge the spirit in the name of GOD, and <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> from your heart, that neither she nor any of them all <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> their <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> any more.  So she said as <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton willed her, speaking <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> heartily.  The same child again said, truly the thing saith I <normalised orig="thanke" auto="true">thank</normalised> God, that I shall <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> it more after the Tuesday after Twelfeday.  Saith <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton, it is well <normalised orig="thankes" auto="true">thanks</normalised> be to God, charge the spirit <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> in the name of God, and <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> from your heart, and be not <normalised orig="afraide" auto="true">afraid</normalised>, that he depart from them all now at this present, and that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> to them <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, <normalised orig="whiche" auto="true">which</normalised> <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> she uttered <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="loude" auto="true">loud</normalised>, and <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> boldly.  So <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as she had ended, then those three children that were then in their fits, & had so <normalised orig="contined" auto="true">continued</normalised> for the space of three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised>, wiped their eyes, and at that instant thrust <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> the <normalised orig="stooles" auto="true">stools</normalised> whereon they sat, and stood <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> their <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised>, being as well as ever they were in their <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised>.  M. Throgmorton had his face now towards the children, & his back to the old woman, & seeing them so to start up <normalised orig="sodenly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised>, said <normalised orig="thankes" auto="true">thanks</normalised> be to God.  While he was thus speaking (little knowing or thinking indeed of any such matter) y old woman fell down behind him on her knees & said, good M. <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised> me.  He turned him about, and seeing her down, said, why mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> what is the matter? O sir said she, I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> the cause

of all this trouble to your children.  <normalised orig="Haue" auto="true">Have</normalised> you mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised>? and why so? what cause did I <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> you thus to use me and my children? None at all <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she.  Then said <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton, you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> done me the more wrong.  Good <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised> me.  God <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised> you <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he, and I do: But tell me, how came you to be such a <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of woman? <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised>, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> forsake my maker, and <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> my <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> to the <normalised orig="divell" auto="true">devil</normalised> (these were her <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>.) And old <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Throgmorton their grand-mother, and mistresses Throgmorton their mother, begin now in the hall, (for this was done in the parlour,) hearing them <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> loud (not understanding the matter perfectly) came in into the parlour, of <normalised orig="whome" auto="true">whom</normalised>, (when mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> saw her) she asked likewise <normalised orig="forgiuenesse" auto="true">forgiveness</normalised>.  <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Thorgmorton their mother, presently without any questions forgque her with all her heart, yet she could not well tell what the matter was.  Mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> asked those three children that were there <normalised orig="forgiuenesse" auto="true">forgiveness</normalised>, and afterwards the rest, kissing all of them: the children easily <normalised orig="forgaue" auto="true">forgave</normalised> her, for they knew not that she had offended any of them, in their own persons: (except what they saw in their sisters, when they <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised> were out of their fits.)  <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throgmorton & his wife, <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised> the old <normalised orig="woma" auto="true">woman</normalised> thus penitent, and so greatly cast <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>: for she did nothing but weep & lament all this time, comforted her by all the good <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> they could, and said that they would freely <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised> he rfrom their hearts, so be it their children might <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> be more troubled.  She answered, that she trusted in God, they should <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> their fits again, yet would she not be comforted for any thing that they could say.  Then M. Throgmorton did send for M. Doctor Dorrington, the Minister of that town, & told him all the matter with the circumstances, desiring him to comfort her, which they all <normalised orig="ioyning" auto="true">joining</normalised> <normalised orig="togither" auto="true">together</normalised>, did so well as they could at that present: yet could not she <normalised orig="forbeare" auto="true">forbear</normalised> weeping, & so continued all that night.  The next day which was the Sabboth day, and Christmas <normalised orig="eue" auto="true">eve</normalised>, M. Doctor Dorrington chose his text of repentance out of the <normalised orig="Psalmes" auto="true">Psalms</normalised>, on set purpose to comfort her, and there declared in the open assembly, all the matter of mother Samuelles late confession, applying his <normalised orig="speeche" auto="true">speech</normalised> <normalised orig="directlie" auto="true">directly</normalised> to the comforting of a penitent heart, and so by consequence of her.  All this Sermon

time, mother Samuel did nothing but <normalised orig="weepe" auto="true">weep</normalised> and lament, and many times was so very <normalised orig="loude" auto="true">loud</normalised> with <normalised orig="sundrie" auto="true">sundry</normalised> passions, that she cansed all the church to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> on <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised>.  And thus much farther you <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> know for this point: <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton the same day after <normalised orig="praiers" auto="true">prayers</normalised> were ended, very wisely <normalised orig="remembring" auto="true">remembering</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, and the old <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> <normalised orig="unconstancie" auto="true">inconstancy</normalised> heretofore, called to mind y there was none present at her confession but <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> and <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Doctor, with his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="houshold" auto="true">household</normalised>, who might be all thought <normalised orig="partiall" auto="true">partial</normalised> in this matter, willed therefore mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> to come into the body of the church, and there <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> of her before his neighbours, whether that confession which she over night had made to him and <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Doctor was wrested <normalised orig="wroong" auto="true">wrong</normalised> out of her, or whether it <normalised orig="proceede" auto="true">proceed</normalised> frankly and freely of and from her self.  She answered before them all that it came of <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, and desired all her neighbours to pray to God for her, and to <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised> her.

Towards night <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> doctor Dorrington understanding the old woman still to continue in this <normalised orig="heauie" auto="true">heavy</normalised> case, came to <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmortons house (who is his brother in law by marriage) and <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> him (upon <normalised orig="simplicitie" auto="true">simplicity</normalised> of good will) tendying the old <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> comfort, to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> her <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> to go home to her husband, and he would be a <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> that her husband should <normalised orig="receaue" auto="true">receive</normalised> her, and to reconcile them together, wherein the old woman was <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> <normalised orig="dutifull" auto="true">dutiful</normalised>.  To this motion <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton did easily <normalised orig="graunt" auto="true">grant</normalised> at the first, being as willing to comfort the old woman, as any, and indeed used the means <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> also that her husband might <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> her, little suspecteing that any thing should fall out thereby otherwise then well.  The man when he understood of it, spoke bluntly (as his manner was) saying that she might come home if she would.

Now that you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> heard this old <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> confession, it may <normalised orig="happilie" auto="true">happily</normalised> <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> strange in some points to some, but for the truth of it, it is as <normalised orig="certainlie" auto="true">certainly</normalised> true, as is any part of this <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>, both the mtter and the <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised>, and the words also observued in al points, so <normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> as possibly could be <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised>.  Mother Samuel is now upon Christmas even at night gone home to her husband and her daughter, <normalised orig="wher" auto="true">where</normalised> we doubt she hath a cold welcome for her <normalised orig="intertainment" auto="true">entertainment</normalised>, and the rather because she hath confessed this matter, for it should seem that they both set upon her (as she her self after

confessed, & so far forth prevailed with her, as that the next morning, which was Christmas day, she denied all that she had <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> before, and it was no such matter with her.  Before night it came to M. Throgmortons hearing that this new convert had <normalised orig="reuolted" auto="true">revolted</normalised> again, and had denied all that she had spoken to him: the best comfort he had herein, was the open confession she made in the church, and <normalised orig="therupon" auto="true">thereupon</normalised> did hardly <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> that which was reported of her.

The same day in the evening, <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> doctor Dorington and M. Throgmorton wet to her house to know the truth, and when they came at the <normalised orig="dore" auto="true">door</normalised> it pleased God that Iohn Samuel, his wie, and his daughter were talking of this matter; for it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> that it was all their <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised>, which they understanding, stayed a while, and heard the daughter say these words, <normalised orig="Beleeue" auto="true">Believe</normalised> them not, <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> them not, for all their <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> speeches.  Here upon they went both presently into the house and changed the daughter with these words, which she utterly denied, as did also the father and the mother.  Then did <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton <normalised orig="demaund" auto="true">demand</normalised> of her, concerning the matter which before she had confessed in his house and in the church, telling her that he had heard that she had denied it <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>.  She answered, that she would <normalised orig="denie" auto="true">deny</normalised> that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was a witch, or any cause of the troubling of his children.  Why <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he, did not you <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> so much unto me? I said so (<normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised> she) indeed, but it is nothing so.  Why then, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he, I must not <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> you that <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised> with I promised : I will surely <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> you before the Justices: but <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he, why did you <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it to be so to me, if it be not so? She answered, for <normalised orig="ioy" auto="true">joy</normalised>, For <normalised orig="ioy" auto="true">joy</normalised>, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he, (smiling to <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, <normalised orig="maruelling" auto="true">marvelling</normalised> what she could make of it) and why for <normalised orig="ioy" auto="true">joy</normalised>?  Because <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, I did see your children so presently well, after your good prayers and mine.  Then <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton unto her, I pray God so continue them, not withstanding howsoever it bee, I will not let <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> this matter thus, for seeing it is published, <normalised orig="eyther" auto="true">either</normalised> you or I will <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised> the shame of it in the end, and so they departed for that night.

The next morning betimes, <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton went to <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> doctor Doringtons house, and told him, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would not suffer this matter thus to die in his hand, least the worser sort of the people should imagine that this was but some <normalised orig="deuise" auto="true">devise</normalised>

of theirs, to bring the old woman into further danger.  So they agreed to <normalised orig="approue" auto="true">approve</normalised> her once <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> in this mtter, and sending for her to the Church, they found her father off from confessing anything that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> or done, then <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> she was before.  Then <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her by the hand, and <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> that both she and her daughter should that day (by Gods grace) go with him to my Lord the Bishop of Lincolnes.  So he presently sent for the Constables, and charged them with the mother and the daughter, and willed them to <normalised orig="prouide" auto="true">provide</normalised> for the <normalised orig="iourney" auto="true">journey</normalised>.

When the old woman <normalised orig="perceiued" auto="true">perceived</normalised> preparation for the <normalised orig="iourney" auto="true">journey</normalised>, and the Constables in a <normalised orig="readinesse" auto="true">readiness</normalised>, <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton also putting on of his boots, she came to him and <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> if you will go with me into the <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised>, I <normalised orig="wll" auto="true">well</normalised> <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> all to you alone.  <normalised orig="Sayd" auto="true">Said</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised>, I will go.  So they went together, and there she confessed the whole matter <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> unto him which before <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had done.  Why then <normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised> he, tell me why <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> you denied it all this time? Oh <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, I would <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> denied it but for my husband and my daughter, who <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> that I was a <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> in confessing of it, and that it had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> better for me to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> died in the same estate I was in, then to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> a Witch, for now <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> will call me old Witch <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> I live.  <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throgmorton told her, if she would persist in confessing the truth, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> her all the favour he could.  In this <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> while <normalised orig="commeth" auto="true">comes</normalised> in unto them <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Doctor Dorington, and he fell into questioning with her, but she seemed something coldly to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> that unto him which before she had done: so he <normalised orig="drue" auto="true">drew</normalised> her aside, and <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton went from them.  Then did <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Doctor Dorington call for <normalised orig="penne" auto="true">pen</normalised>, <normalised orig="ynke" auto="true">ink</normalised>, and paper, and wrote <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> that <normalised orig="confesion" auto="true">confession</normalised> which she made.  In the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> time <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton sent to the Church, which is <normalised orig="adioyning" auto="true">adjoining</normalised> to his house, and there being <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> of his neighbours, for it was about prayers time, he desired them to come to him, and telling them the matter, placed them hard underneath the <normalised orig="Parlor" auto="true">Parlour</normalised> window where <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> doctor and this old woman were talking together.  <normalised orig="Wherof" auto="true">Whereof</normalised> when notice was <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> to <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Doctor, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> spake very <normalised orig="loude" auto="true">loud</normalised>, and willed the old woman to lift up her voice also, faining something, so that the neighbours which were without might easily <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> all y words that passed between them,  <normalised orig="Whe" auto="true">When</normalised> they had done, M. Throgmorton went unto them into the <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised>, & desired them to come forth into the hall : when they came, there stood al y <normalised orig="neighbors" auto="true">neighbours</normalised> that had heard this matter, then <normalised orig="beganne" auto="true">began</normalised> M. Doctor to read in their presence that which the woman had confessed, but she would <normalised orig="faine" auto="true">fine</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> denied al again.  Nay said the <normalised orig="neighbors" auto="true">neighbours</normalised> to her, it is too late to <normalised orig="denie" auto="true">deny</normalised> any thing now, for we heard al this with our ears, telling to her the place where they were.  When she <normalised orig="perceiued" auto="true">perceived</normalised> herself thus catched in a trap, she would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> made the best of it, but it would not <normalised orig="prevaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised>.  As they were thus in the house together, came in Iohn <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, the old <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> husband, who had understood that there was <normalised orig="somthing" auto="true">something</normalised> to do in the house cocerning his wife.  <normalised orig="Whe" auto="true">When</normalised> he was come, M. Throgmorton told him that which his wife had <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> confessed, & with the rest he said, that his wife would <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> denied that which she did but for him and his daughter.  Hast thou <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> so: <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he to his wife (<normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> a <normalised orig="foule" auto="true">foul</normalised> <normalised orig="terme" auto="true">term</normalised>) and with that would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> stricken her, had not others stood betwixt them.  The old woman <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised> her husband thus fiercely <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> towards her, <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> down presently in a <normalised orig="counterfet" auto="true">counterfeit</normalised> sound before the all.  <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Throgmorton standing by, was on the sudden marvellously <normalised orig="amased" auto="true">amassed</normalised> <normalised orig="therat" auto="true">thereat</normalised>, & called for <normalised orig="aquavite" auto="true">aquavit</normalised> for <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised>.  When they <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her up, they <normalised orig="perceiued" auto="true">perceived</normalised> her countenance nothing altered, but ath she looked <normalised orig="chearefull" auto="true">cheerful</normalised> <normalised orig="ynough" auto="true">enough</normalised>.  One of her <normalised orig="neighbors" auto="true">neighbours</normalised> standing by, peradventure better acquainted with her fashions then the rest, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, if they would let her alone, he would be their warrant, that she would doe well <normalised orig="ynough" auto="true">enough</normalised>: so presently after she came to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and al was well.  These circumstances about her confession are therefore the more <normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised> set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> although they be not so pertinent to the matter, neither indeed should have <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> declared at all, had it not ben reported by some in the <normalised orig="countrie" auto="true">country</normalised>, and those that thought themselves wise, that this mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> now in question, was an old simple woman, and that one might make her by fair words <normalised orig="cofesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> what they would.  But to <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> that to the <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> of them that knew her well <normalised orig="ynough" auto="true">enough</normalised>, <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Throgmorton continued on his <normalised orig="iornie" auto="true">journey</normalised>, purposing to discharge <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> of the matter, and caused the old woman with her daughter to be carried the same day to my :. the Bishop of Lincoln, and there he examined her and her daughter.

The Examination of Alice <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> of Warbois, in the <normalised orig="countie" auto="true">county</normalised> of Huntinngton, taken at Buckden before the right <normalised orig="reuerend" auto="true">reverend</normalised> Father in God, William, by Gods permission Bishop of <normalised orig="Lincolne" auto="true">Lincoln</normalised>, the 26 of December, 1592.

Being asked whether a dun chicken did ever suck on her chin, and how often, the said Examinat <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised>, that it sucked <normalised orig="twise" auto="true">twice</normalised> and no more since Christmas <normalised orig="euens" auto="true">evens</normalised> <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> last. Being asked whether it was a natural chicken, she saith that it was not, she <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> that it was no natural chicken, because when it came to her chin she scarce <normalised orig="feele" auto="true">feel</normalised> it, but when she wiped it off with her hand, her chin did bleed. She saith further, that the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> dun chicken first come unto her and <normalised orig="sucke" auto="true">suck</normalised> on her chin before it came to M. Throgmortons house, and that the ill and the trouble that hath come to M. Throgmortons children, hath come by means of the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> dun chicken, the which chicken she <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> is now both gone from them and from her.  And further she <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised>, that M. Throgmorton and M. doctor Dorington shall bring further information of such things as yet she hat not declared. 

The Examination of Alice <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> of Warboyi in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Huntington, taken at Buckden the 29 day of December 1592, before the <normalised orig="reuerend" auto="true">reverend</normalised> Father in God, William by Gods permission Bishop of <normalised orig="Lincolne" auto="true">Lincoln</normalised>, Francis Crumwell, and Richard Tryce, Esquires, <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of her Maiesty's peace within the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> <normalised orig="aforesayd" auto="true">aforesaid</normalised>.

She saith that she never did hurt to any, <normalised orig="sauing" auto="true">saving</normalised> to the <normalised orig="childre" auto="true">children</normalised> in question. Being <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> how she <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> the said dun chicken is gone from the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> children: <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised>, because the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> dun chicken, with the rest, are now come into her, and are now in the <normalised orig="bottome" auto="true">bottom</normalised> of her <normalised orig="bellie" auto="true">belly</normalised>, and make her so full, that she is like to burst, and this morning they caused her to be so full, that she could scant lace her cote, and that on the way as she came, they weighed so <normalised orig="heuie" auto="true">heavy</normalised>, that the horse she rid on did fall <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> and was not able to <normalised orig="carrie" auto="true">carry</normalised> her.  And further she <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised> that the upright man of <normalised orig="whome" auto="true">whom</normalised> she hath confessed to <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton, told her that M. Throgmorton

was a hard man & would trouble her much, wherefore he would give her six spirits that should vex and torment his children, and so he did: which spirits had reward from her by sucking of her blood oftentimes when they were without her body, and that the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> spirits did suck of her blood before she sent the forth any whither. She saith further, that whatsoever the children of M. Throg. did <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> in their fits <normalised orig="prooued" auto="true">proved</normalised> true & was true: as for example, <normalised orig="whesoever" auto="true">whosoever</normalised> the said children said they did see the said spirits, then were the spirits there, & she did also see the. And she saith, y often times she did <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> a <normalised orig="privie" auto="true">privy</normalised> <normalised orig="becke" auto="true">beck</normalised> or nod, with her finger or head, & then the spirits presently stopped the childrens mouths, that they could not <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> they came out <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>: & then would y children wipe their eyes and be well again. Further she saith, that it was taught her of a ma that did come unto her house, but where he dwell, or what his name was, she cannot tell, who told her that if she would call the said six spirits they would come: and she called them, & they appeared in the <normalised orig="likenes" auto="true">likeness</normalised> of dun chickens, their names were as <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>: first, Pluck; <normalised orig="secod" auto="true">second</normalised>, Catch; the third White; and the other three she called with her mouth with three smacks: and two of them, she (this examinate) sent to M. <normalised orig="Ro" auto="true">To</normalised>. Throgmorton of Warbois and his wife, and they returned again, and told her that God would not suffer them to <normalised orig="prevaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised>. <normalised orig="Wherupon" auto="true">Whereupon</normalised> she (this Examinat) sent the said spirits to the children of the said M. Throg. by means of <normalised orig="wherof" auto="true">whereof</normalised> they <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> ben so strangely <normalised orig="tormeted" auto="true">tormented</normalised>, as to the neighbours and <normalised orig="countrie" auto="true">country</normalised> hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised>. She <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised> further, that what the children <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> in their fits in her hearing, y it was true, & so it <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> out.   Being asked further what the upright mans name was that gavu her the <normalised orig="diuels" auto="true">devils</normalised>, she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> that she could not tell: <normalised orig="wherupon" auto="true">whereupon</normalised> she was <normalised orig="moued" auto="true">moved</normalised> to go into another chamber, & demand of her spirits what his name was, which she presently did,  & there with a loud voice <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> these words as <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised> O thou <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised>, I charge thee in the name of the Father, the Son, & the Holy-ghost, that thou tel me the name of the <normalised orig="vpright" auto="true">upright</normalised> man which <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> me the <normalised orig="deuils" auto="true">devils</normalised>: which thing she did three times, and the returned saying, that her spirits had told her y his name was Langlad. And being <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> where the said Langland dwelled, she said she could not tell. Then was she <normalised orig="mooued" auto="true">moved</normalised> to go into the said chamber again, and <normalised orig="demaund" auto="true">demand</normalised> of her spirits where y said Langland dwelt: which

also she presently did, and there with a <normalised orig="lowd" auto="true">loud</normalised> voice three times <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, O <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised> I charge thee in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy-ghost tel me where the said Langland <normalised orig="dwelleth" auto="true">dwells</normalised>, then she returned and <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> that he had no dwelling. Then was she further moved to go again & demand where y said Langland was at that present, which also she did, and <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> as before, & returned with this answer, That her spirits told her that he went on the last <normalised orig="voiage" auto="true">voyage</normalised> beyond the seas.  After these cofessions thus made, mother Samuel and <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> daughter were committed to the <normalised orig="gayle" auto="true">gail</normalised> of Huntington. Now that we <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> brought mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> to the <normalised orig="gayle" auto="true">gail</normalised>, we will let her there rest in Gods peace and the <normalised orig="Queenes" auto="true">Queens</normalised> <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> the next <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised> day holden at Huntington, and  although many things <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> out unhappily concerning her, during her continuance in the <normalised orig="gayle" auto="true">gail</normalised>, whereof she was greatly suspected, as the death of one of the Gaylers servants whom she <normalised orig="threatned" auto="true">threatened</normalised>, the extreme <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> of one of his children, with his present ammending after the scratching of her, and diverse other <normalised orig="thinges" auto="true">things</normalised> which are shrewd <normalised orig="peeces" auto="true">pieces</normalised> of evidence against her, if there had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> nothing else <normalised orig="layd" auto="true">laid</normalised> to her charge: yet because they doe not <normalised orig="concerne" auto="true">concern</normalised> the trouble of these children, neither is a matter so perfectly <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> to the authors of this <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>, it is therefore but touched by the way.

And to come to the daughter Agnes Samuel, who now <normalised orig="cometh" auto="true">comes</normalised> upon the stage with her part in this <normalised orig="tragedie" auto="true">tragedy</normalised>, you shall understand that she was left with her mother in the <normalised orig="gayle" auto="true">gail</normalised> until the Sessions day held at Huntington the 9 of <normalised orig="Januarie" auto="true">January</normalised> following, which day was the Tuesday that the children so often had spoken of to the old woman.

At dinner time M. Throgmorton made his request to the high <normalised orig="Sheriffe" auto="true">Sheriff</normalised> & the Justices to <normalised orig="baile" auto="true">bail</normalised> this maid, & to have her home to his house, to see, if it might please God, whether any such evidences of <normalised orig="guiltinesse" auto="true">guiltiness</normalised> would <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> against her, as had before appeared in the children against the mother. This <normalised orig="sute" auto="true">suit</normalised> was not easily granted, for it was a demur amongst the <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> whether the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised> was baylable by law in this case or no.  In the end M. Throgmorton cotinuing his <normalised orig="sute" auto="true">suit</normalised>, they being resolved of y doubt, and <normalised orig="graunted" auto="true">granted</normalised> it: but it was almost three of the clock in the afternoon before, as every body ca <normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> y were the present: which time
is therefore here mentioned because it hath relation to the next point that hereafter <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>, as you shall <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>.

The report of M. Doctor Dorington of that which happened at Warbois, on Tuesday which was the Sessions day at Huntington, the 9 of <normalised orig="Ianuary" auto="true">January</normalised>.

About twelve of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> a little before dinner, Mary, Ione, and Grace, the

daughters of Robert Throgmorton of Warbois aforesaid, Esquier, fell into their accustomed fits of <normalised orig="lamenesse" auto="true">lameness</normalised>, <normalised orig="blindnesse" auto="true">blindness</normalised>, <normalised orig="deafnesse" auto="true">deafness</normalised>, and want of feeling, only their <normalised orig="yoongest" auto="true">youngest</normalised> brother Robert of the age of nine <normalised orig="yeres" auto="true">years</normalised>, might <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> unto Iane with her understanding, and she only might speak in the like manner to Marie and Grace.

Immediately after dinner their uncle M. doctor Dorington parson of Warbois, <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> to see the with a <normalised orig="scholler" auto="true">scholar</normalised> of Cambridge, found them all three in their fits, which seemed not so <normalised orig="greeuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> at that time as <normalised orig="merrie" auto="true">merry</normalised> and pleasant, repeating oftentimes these words, <normalised orig="ech" auto="true">each</normalised> one of the: I am glad, I am glad, none so glad as I.  The said M. doctor their uncle, willed their brother to <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> the <normalised orig="wherfore" auto="true">wherefore</normalised> they were so glad.  Iane answered him, we <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> know within these two <normalised orig="howers" auto="true">hours</normalised> good <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised>, <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised> wishing that two <normalised orig="howers" auto="true">hours</normalised> were spent, the two other sisters affirmed the same.  Mary and Iane whispering secretly one in the others care, spake thus much in our hearing oftentimes: I <normalised orig="marvell" auto="true">marvel</normalised> how she should know that thing, I am sure none of this house told her, and therefore it cannot be but that the spirits told her.  The said Robert was willed again by his uncle doctor to <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> of Iane, and Iane to <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> of Mary and Grace, when they should come <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> of this fit, they all answered, Now by and by, and then we shall go well al of us into the hall, out of this <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised>, and thence returning quickly y hither <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, we shall presently enter into another <normalised orig="fitt" auto="true">fit</normalised> like unto this, and then you shall <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised>, for by that time the two <normalised orig="howers" auto="true">hours</normalised> will be almost spent: yet after we <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> told the <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> we shall <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> a paying fit, but it shall be short.  All these <normalised orig="thinges" auto="true">things</normalised> foretold, <normalised orig="prooued" auto="true">proved</normalised> most true, fur they came out of their fit perfectly well, they did arise off from their <normalised orig="stooles" auto="true">stools</normalised> <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised>, and all three of them went first out of the great <normalised orig="Parlor" auto="true">Parlour</normalised> into an inward <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> <normalised orig="Parlor" auto="true">Parlour</normalised>, to see how their mother did then being not well at case, and
keeping her bed.  Presently they went from this into the hall, to see their sister Elizabeth then sitting by the fire, and being there, they were willed by one of their kinswomen in the house, not to <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> any more into the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> parlour, but notwithstanding that <normalised orig="counsell" auto="true">counsel</normalised>, they would <normalised orig="needes" auto="true">needs</normalised> go all three into the parlour.  They were no sooner <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> into the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> place, but <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> one of them fell into their former fits, lame, <normalised orig="blinde" auto="true">blind</normalised>, and <normalised orig="deafe" auto="true">deaf</normalised>, insomuch as they must <normalised orig="needes" auto="true">needs</normalised> be carried to their <normalised orig="stooles" auto="true">stools</normalised> by the fire side : where being once placed, they <normalised orig="beganne" auto="true">began</normalised> to <normalised orig="repeate" auto="true">repeat</normalised> again, I am glad, I am glad, none so glad as I, and being demanded why, they answered all three that Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> should be brought to their fathers house from Huntington, and they should not <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> as they did her mother, in their firts because their father should not trouble her with any mo questions, and so the spirit <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> them.  These words <normalised orig="uttred" auto="true">uttered</normalised> they all severally, being asked one after the other, and then they all <normalised orig="togither" auto="true">together</normalised> <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> presently into <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> fits, of bowing their bodies, their heads and <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised> almost meeting <normalised orig="togither" auto="true">together</normalised>, their bellies being highest with great <normalised orig="groning" auto="true">groaning</normalised>.  But this endured not long (<normalised orig="thankes" auto="true">thanks</normalised> be to God,) then rubbing their eyes <normalised orig="twise" auto="true">twice</normalised> or thrice, they seemed as waking out of a sleep, and so became perfectly well as <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> before, Iane uttering these <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> to the spirit, which as it should seem should say, we are gone: then <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Iane answered, farewell and be hanged.  Their uncle Doctor there present with the rest, <normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> thanks to God, asked them all how they did, and they said very well we <normalised orig="thanke" auto="true">thank</normalised> God, <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> being asked how they felt <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised> all this time of two <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised> past, they said y they had bin in a sleep.  He asked them further, if they had dined, which thing he knew they had done, for he found them al at dinner <normalised orig="mery" auto="true">merry</normalised> and pleasant, yet they answered, they had not dined, and yet they had no <normalised orig="stomackes" auto="true">stomachs</normalised>.

After  Agnes Samuel was brought to <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmortons house, the children continued for three or <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> without <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> at all, so that their <normalised orig="parentes" auto="true">parents</normalised> were put in great comfort that their children should then <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="cleane" auto="true">clean</normalised> <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> from their torments: but it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised>, that the matter was not yet brought to an end, for the children fell all of them a fresh into their fits <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and were as <normalised orig="greeuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> afflicted as ever

they were in the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> time, and then the spirits did begin, as plainly to accuse the daughter as ever they did the mother, and do tell the children that the old woman hath set over her spirits to her daughter, and that she hath bewitched them al over <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and that she will <normalised orig="deale" auto="true">deal</normalised> worse with them then ever her mother did. The children in their fits carried the same mind to the daughter and to her spirits, as they did to the mother before, saying that they cared not for any thing, that any of them all could do unto them, for their trust was in God, and he would <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> them out of her <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised> (they <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>;) many very <normalised orig="straunge" auto="true">strange</normalised> things fell out amongst them in one <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised> next after, which because they were not <normalised orig="perticularly" auto="true">particularly</normalised> committed to writing, they are therefore here omitted.

Some after, the maid was thus brought as you here, to continue at M. Throgmortons house: <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> the eldest daughter of the said M. Throgmorton, was brought home likewise fro Tichmarsh <normalised orig="groue" auto="true">grove</normalised>, where we left her, to Warbois to her fathers house, and if it should <normalised orig="perticularly" auto="true">particularly</normalised> be declared how she was dealth <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised> for the time she there continued, it wold ad another third part unto this <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>, & you wold think also that y matters which could be spoken of her, would be nothing superfluous: but to let al that <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised>, let us come unto this present matter, as it was <normalised orig="perticularly" auto="true">particularly</normalised> <normalised orig="obserued" auto="true">observed</normalised> at Warbos.

Upon Friday which was the 9. of February 1592, <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> the eldest daughter of the said M. Throgmorto, <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> into <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> fit as usually before she had done, & complained of great <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> in her legs, which had bin sore 9. or 10. <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> before that, namely, the most part of y time, while she continued at Tichmarsh grove, with her uncle M. Gilbert Pickering.  But after she returned home to her sisters, she grew much worse in her legs the before, and for y space of a <normalised orig="ful" auto="true">full</normalised> fortnight before this day, her legs were so <normalised orig="ful" auto="true">full</normalised> of ache & <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised>, that she could neither <normalised orig="walke" auto="true">walk</normalised> nor sit, but only lye either upon her bed, or <normalised orig="els" auto="true">else</normalised> upon cushions by the fire side.  Cotinuing thus in her fit all that day, towards night the spirit came unto her, & she talked very familiarly with it, as her <normalised orig="commo" auto="true">common</normalised> custom was, demanding of it from whence it came, and what <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> it brought, speaking very disdainfully to it.  The thing answered, that it would not tell her from whence it came, but this was the

<normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> it brought, that she should have <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> fits hereafter, and be worse handled than <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> she was : saying that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> should now <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> her fits, being in perfect memory, and <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> al her senses.  She answered, that she neither feared nor cared for him, for God she said was on her side, and would protect her from him, so the thing departed without any further <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised>, and she continued in her fit, the most part of that night <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> she went to bed.

The next day, which was <normalised orig="Saterday" auto="true">Saturday</normalised>, the tenth of February, for it would be too long to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> of <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> <normalised orig="perticular" auto="true">particular</normalised> <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised>, although almost <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> brought <normalised orig="varietie" auto="true">variety</normalised> with it, in the <normalised orig="afternoone" auto="true">afternoon</normalised> as she <normalised orig="laie" auto="true">lay</normalised> <normalised orig="groning" auto="true">groaning</normalised> in her fit by the fire side, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> fell suddenly into bleeding at the nose, and bleed <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> much, <normalised orig="wheret" auto="true">whereat</normalised> she marvelled (for she did perceive it) saying, I pray God send me good <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> after this, for it is <normalised orig="straunge" auto="true">strange</normalised> with me to <normalised orig="bleede" auto="true">bleed</normalised>, I bled not not so much this <normalised orig="seuen" auto="true">seven</normalised> <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> before, when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had much bloudied her handkercheffe, she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> that it was a good deed to throw the handkercheffe into the fire and <normalised orig="burne" auto="true">burn</normalised> the Witch, for she knew she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, that this bleeding came of no good cause. After she had talked thus to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> a little, it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> the spirit came to her: for she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> thus smiling to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, and casting her eyes about her, what is this in Gods name, that <normalised orig="cometh" auto="true">comes</normalised> thus tumbling to me? It <normalised orig="tumbleth" auto="true">tumbles</normalised> <normalised orig="lyke" auto="true">like</normalised> a football, I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> it be some puppit-plaier, it is much like his dames old thrumd <normalised orig="cappe" auto="true">cap</normalised>. What is your name I pray you <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised>? The thing answered (as it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised>) that his name was Blew. For presently <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the question <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> of his dame, she made <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> saying: <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Blew you are welcome, I never saw you before, I thought <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised>, that my nose <normalised orig="bledde" auto="true">bled</normalised> not for nothing, what <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> you brought? It <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> her as before. What doest thou say saith <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised>, that I shall be worse <normalised orig="handeled" auto="true">handled</normalised> then <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> I was? Ha: saith <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised>, what doest thou say?  (For <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would ever <normalised orig="repeate" auto="true">repeat</normalised> the spirits <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> after him as they all would do, when they were talking with them, bending their <normalised orig="heades" auto="true">heads</normalised> to the <normalised orig="grounde" auto="true">ground</normalised>) that I shall now have my <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, when I shall both <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>, see, and know <normalised orig="everie" auto="true">every</normalised> <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>, that is a new <normalised orig="tricke" auto="true">trick</normalised> indeed, I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> any of my sisters were so used, but I care not
for you (said she) do your worst. And when you have done, you will make an end, these were her <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> words.

Then was she silent a while, yet seemed to listen to something that the spirit did say, and presently called for Agnes Samuel, and asked where she was, saying y she had but too much <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised>, and that she must be more straightly looked unto, for of late (said she) she was in y <normalised orig="kitchin" auto="true">kitchen</normalised> chamber talking with her spirits (for so <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Blew had told her) and <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> him not to let me <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> any such extreme fits, when I should both <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>, & know <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> body.  But he answered, that he would torment me in y sort, and not <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> until he had brought his dame, meaning Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, unto her end.  So that now, saith <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> to her (for by that time she was called into the place to her) you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> spun a <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> thread: you <normalised orig="diuels" auto="true">devils</normalised> (for so then she called them) <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> be no longer at your <normalised orig="commandement" auto="true">commandment</normalised>: it will be no better with us, said she, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> you & your mother be both hanged.  The <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised> standing by and hearing this, confessed indeed that she was in the <normalised orig="kitchin" auto="true">kitchen</normalised> chamber and alone: but she denied that she talked with any spirits, nor yet knew of any such <normalised orig="thinges" auto="true">things</normalised>.  <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> hearing her say so: willed her not to <normalised orig="denie" auto="true">deny</normalised> it, for it was surely so, she thought, saying, that she knew the spirits would not lye to her.  <normalised orig="Soone" auto="true">Soon</normalised> after, she came out of this fit, and greatly complained of <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> in her <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised>, and being presently demanded where she had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised>, and what she had said.  She answered that she had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> a <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised>, and had said nothing that she knew of, marvelling much how her handkerchiffe which she had in her hand, should come to be so <normalised orig="bloudie" auto="true">bloody</normalised>, for said she, it was not so <normalised orig="eue" auto="true">eve</normalised> now, & I am sure that I use not to bleed: I <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> said she, some <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> it from me, and bloudied it & hath <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> me it <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, (for this is the same handkerchiffe I had <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> now, with many such like speeches.

At night presently, on her father and mothers rising from supper, she fell into the fit which before M. Blue had threatened her, for she was most <normalised orig="greeuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> <normalised orig="wroong" auto="true">wrong</normalised> & twitched in <normalised orig="everie" auto="true">every</normalised> part of her body, <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> she wold thrust forth her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> so straight, and so <normalised orig="stiffe" auto="true">stiff</normalised>, that it was not possible to bow them: sometimes <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, she would so wrest and writhe them <normalised orig="cleane" auto="true">clean</normalised> backwards as that no man or woman were able to do the like, by their
<normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised> strength, she her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> crying out very pitifully, sometimes of her <normalised orig="stomacke" auto="true">stomach</normalised>, saying that she was very sick, and offered to vomit, sometimes of her head, and other whiles of her belly, and <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> a part or member of her, was free from <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> pain, she her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> ever calling upon God to <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> upon her, and <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> her. <normalised orig="Somtimes" auto="true">Sometimes</normalised> it would so stop her breath, and hold it so long, that when she could <normalised orig="recouer" auto="true">recover</normalised> it <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, she fetched a marvellous <normalised orig="deepe" auto="true">deep</normalised> and loud <normalised orig="grone" auto="true">groan</normalised>. And being oftentimes asked in this fit by <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> that stood by how she did, she made <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised>, that she was marvellous <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> and full of <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised>, affirming that she both heard and saw, all that were present. In this <normalised orig="wofull" auto="true">woeful</normalised> case she continued the space of <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> and more, to the great <normalised orig="greefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> of the beholders, (for this is one of the first fits, that either she or her sisters had, having their perfect senses.) Now on the <normalised orig="suddain" auto="true">sudden</normalised> as she was thus complaining, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> fell into her <normalised orig="senselesse" auto="true">senseless</normalised> fit, having her mouth also shut up, and now she is deprived of all <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of <normalised orig="sence" auto="true">sense</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>. Remaining thus quietly a <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> space, she fetched a great <normalised orig="groane" auto="true">groan</normalised>, whereupon her mouth was opened, and she spake saying: Here is a rule <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised>, I perceive that you are as good as your word with me, from whence come you now, and what <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> do you bring now I pray you? The thing answered, that she must be yet worse handled then all this <normalised orig="commeth" auto="true">comes</normalised> unto. Saith she, God is above the <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised>, and do what you can, for you shall not be able to hurt me. But tell me, why do you punish me worse then all my sisters, <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> my fits when I can know <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>?  The thing answered, because she told tales of their dame: who is your dame (saith she?) he answered Nan <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>. And this you must understand, in all their <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of talking together, that the children would first <normalised orig="repeate" auto="true">repeat</normalised> the spirits <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised>, before they would <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> any further <normalised orig="questio" auto="true">question</normalised> of them. The said she, if Nan Samuel be your dame, I will tell more tales of her yet, and I hope to tell such a tale of her one day, that she shall not be able to <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> it, nor you for her. The thing answered, that he would then punish her the more for it. She said that she cared not for that. Then said the thing, when was <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> with you?  (This <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> was an other of the spirits names.) Saith she, I know no such <normalised orig="felow" auto="true">fellow</normalised> as Smack is, yes saith the thing,that you do: and he it is that <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> you all these <normalised orig="thinges" auto="true">things</normalised>, but I will course him for it. Saith she, do your

worst to him or to me, for I care not for you. Farewell, saith the thing. Do you bid me farewell, saith she? fare you <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> & be hanged (for you <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> the truth as she spoke it) & come again saith she when you are sent for.  <normalised orig="Soone" auto="true">Soon</normalised> after this she came forth of her fit and was very sick, and full of pain in her legs.  The next day which was the Sabboth, she was reasonable well all the <normalised orig="forenoone" auto="true">forenoon</normalised>, as she was all other <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, but her greatest <normalised orig="panges" auto="true">pangs</normalised> & fits were <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> towards night.  And thus <normalised orig="leauing" auto="true">leaving</normalised> her until night, you <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> what happened, the same day, amongst others of her sisters.  <normalised orig="Soone" auto="true">Soon</normalised> after dinner was ended, there came unto the house one <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Throgmorton of Brampton, to see how these children did, & staying in the <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised> a little while, one of these children, <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Elizabeth by name, as she was <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> in at the <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised> <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>, fell <normalised orig="sodenly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> into her fit in the sight of them all, which was not strange to any, but to the gentleman (because it was an usual thing with her.) Cotinuing thus a little space, M. Throgmorton the childes father, said to the other M. Throgmorton his kinsman, will you see <normalised orig="cosin" auto="true">cousin</normalised> saith he, a wonder? Saith the gentleman, <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> you any greater wonders the to see this sight?  Saith the childes father, I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> as great, for you shall se this <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> brought out of this case <normalised orig="wherin" auto="true">wherein</normalised> now you see her, at the pronouncing of certain words by a <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised> in this house.  Saith the gentleman, I would <normalised orig="faine" auto="true">fine</normalised> see that, for i am <normalised orig="sorie" auto="true">sorry</normalised> to see this <normalised orig="signt" auto="true">signed</normalised>.  So the childes father called for Agnes Samuel, and willed her to say to the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> these <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>, I charge thee <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised> in the name of the God of heaven and earth as I hate thee, an am no Witch, nor <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> of this matter, that thou depart from this <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, and suffer her to come forth of her fit.  This said by the <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised>, the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> <normalised orig="moued" auto="true">moved</normalised> not.  Then the childes father willed her to say thus, I charge thee thou <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised>, as I <normalised orig="loue" auto="true">love</normalised> thee, and <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="authoritie" auto="true">authority</normalised> <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> thee, and am a Witch, and <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> of this matter, that thou suffer this <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> to be well at this present.  These words were no sooner ended, but the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> wiped her eyes, and was as well as any in the parlour.  As the gentleman was thus <normalised orig="wondring" auto="true">wondering</normalised> and talking with this maid about the matter, saying that she could tel a <normalised orig="prettie" auto="true">pretty</normalised> tale for her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, another of those children <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Iane standing by fell presently into her fit, and the same experience was made by her, as was made by her sister before.  And this was

<normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised> amongst them, for it had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> times, and was foretold by the spirit to one of them being in her fit, (a fortnight before this time:) that <normalised orig="whensoever" auto="true">whenever</normalised> Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> should say these words, they should be presently well.

To <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> to <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised>, who was very sick & <normalised orig="ful" auto="true">full</normalised> of pain all that day, & when night came, presently after supper fell into the same <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of fit, which she had the night before, for she was most <normalised orig="greeuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> twitched, wrong, & tormented in <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> part of her body, <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> her perfect <normalised orig="sences" auto="true">senses</normalised>, for she was able to see, <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>, and understand, <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> thing that was asked of her, & this kind of fit continuing some certain space, she fell on the <normalised orig="suddaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> into a <normalised orig="senslesse" auto="true">senseless</normalised> fit: and being silent a while, <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> her mouth shut up, she fetched a great <normalised orig="groane" auto="true">groan</normalised>, and said, from whence come you M. <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised>, and what <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> do you bring? The spirit answered, that he came from fighting.  From fighting saith she, with who, I pray you? The spirit answered with Pluck, (which was an other of the spirits names.)  Where did you fight I pray you said she? The spirit answered in his old dames backhouse, which is an old house standing in mother Samuels <normalised orig="yarde" auto="true">yard</normalised>, and they fought with great cowlstraves, this last night.  And who got the maistry I pray you said she?  He answered that he broke Plucks heard.  Saith she, I would that he had broke your neck also.  Saith the spirit, is that all the <normalised orig="thanke" auto="true">thank</normalised> that I shall <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> for my labour? Why saith she, do you <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> for thanks at my hands?  I would you were all hanged up one against another, and your dame and all, for you are all nought, but it is no matter saith she, I do not well to curse you, for God I trust <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> defend me from you all.  So he departed and had her farewell.  And being asked by her when he would come <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, he said on Wednesday at night, he was no sooner gone, but presently came Pluck to her.  For she said, from whence come you Pluck, with your head hanging <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> in that sort.  So he answered her in all respects, according as <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> before had told her.  Then said the spirit to her, when saw you Smack.  She answered, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> knew no such fellow.  He said, yes that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> wold not be to know of him.  It <normalised orig="shuld" auto="true">should</normalised> seem said she, that you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> met with your match, & with <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> such like speeches betwixt the he departed.  And she soon after came out of her fit, but was very il, & <normalised orig="coplained" auto="true">complained</normalised> of <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> in her legs.  The next day being <normalised orig="munday" auto="true">monday</normalised>, she

was <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> all the day, and in the <normalised orig="afternoone" auto="true">afternoon</normalised> she fell into a marvellous <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> fit having perfect sense, for the space of <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> or more.  Agnes Samuel standing by, and seeing the <normalised orig="extremitie" auto="true">extremity</normalised> thereof, seemed to pray with others <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> heartily for her: for the greevousnesse of that sight would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> moved <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> stony heart in the world to <normalised orig="pittie" auto="true">pity</normalised>.  And being asked of the matter, what she thought of it, and whether it was <normalised orig="wantonnesse" auto="true">wantonness</normalised> or not, as she had oftentimes said before, she came to the house (as <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> as her mother had done) but now she could not deny, but that it was some <normalised orig="supernaturall" auto="true">supernatural</normalised> <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> in the patient.  Notwithstanding as may be thought, she that was thus tormented, <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> once <normalised orig="conceiued" auto="true">conceived</normalised> an <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> thought against her, all the time that she had her perfect <normalised orig="sences" auto="true">senses</normalised>: this kind of fit ended she was well excepting the <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> in her legs.  After supper, so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as her parents were risen with the rest, she fell into the same fit <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> having her <normalised orig="sences" auto="true">senses</normalised>, and within <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised>, she was on the <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> snatched into her <normalised orig="sencelesse" auto="true">senseless</normalised> fit, and presently she had her mouth opened, & said, will this <normalised orig="geare" auto="true">gear</normalised> <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> be left?  I hope it <normalised orig="wilbe" auto="true">will be</normalised> better one day with you, from whence come you now Catch (saith she) limping in that sort? I hope you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> met with your match.  Catch answered, that <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> and he had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> fighting, and that Smack had broken his leg.  Said she, that <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> is a shrewd fellow belike, I would I could once see him.  Pluck came yesternight (said she) with his head broken, and now he hath broken your leg, I hope said she, that he will <normalised orig="breake" auto="true">break</normalised> both your necks before he <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> done with you.  Catch answered, that he would be <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> with him before he had done.  Then said she, put forth your other leg, let me see if I can <normalised orig="breake" auto="true">break</normalised> that also, for she had a <normalised orig="sticke" auto="true">stick</normalised> in her hand, the spirit told her that she could not hit him.  Can I not hit you said she? let me try.  Then the spirit as it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised>, put out his leg, for she lifted up her <normalised orig="sticke" auto="true">stick</normalised> easily, and <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> a great <normalised orig="stroake" auto="true">stroke</normalised> on the <normalised orig="grounde" auto="true">ground</normalised>.  You <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> not hurt me said the spirit.  Have I not hurt you <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she?  no, but I would if I could, for then would I make some of you come short home.  So she seemed <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> times to strike at the spirit, but he leaped over y stick as she said, as if it had bin a Jacke of Apes.  So after many such <normalised orig="toyes" auto="true">toys</normalised> used betwixt them, the spirit departed, & she came forth of her fit, continuing all that night and the next day very sick, and full of pain in her legs.  At night when supper was ended she fell into her sensible fit <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and continuing therein <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> an <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised>, she fell into another kind of fit which is common to her & the rest of her sisters, and resting so silent a little space, she fetched a great <normalised orig="grone" auto="true">groan</normalised> & said, Na sirrah, are you come now with your <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised> in a sling M. Blew? who hath met with you I pray? The spirit answered, You know <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> <normalised orig="ynough" auto="true">enough</normalised>. Do I know (<normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she) well <normalised orig="ynough" auto="true">enough</normalised>? how should I know? Why (<normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> the spirit) Smack and I were fighting, and he hath broken mine <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised>, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, that smack is a stout fellow indeed belike, I hope he will <normalised orig="breake" auto="true">break</normalised> all your <normalised orig="neckes" auto="true">necks</normalised> because you punish <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> without a cause.  I would <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she that I could once be acquainted with him.  We will be <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> with him (<normalised orig="sayeth" auto="true">says</normalised> Blew) one day.  Why <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, what will you do?  The spirit <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, That they would all fall upon him and beat him.  <normalised orig="Sayd" auto="true">Said</normalised> she, Belike he <normalised orig="careth" auto="true">cares</normalised> not for you all, for he hath broken Plucks head, Catches <normalised orig="legge" auto="true">leg</normalised>, and your <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised>, now you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> something to do, you may go <normalised orig="heale" auto="true">heal</normalised> your <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised>.  Yea (said the spirit) <normalised orig="whe" auto="true">when</normalised> mine <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised> is whole we will beat <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised>.  So for that night they parted, and she came out of her fit, <normalised orig="complayning" auto="true">complaining</normalised> of many parts of her body, so as it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> that she was more <normalised orig="hartie" auto="true">hearty</normalised> and better at ease while the spirit talked with her by <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised>, then she was when she came <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> of her fit, for she would greatly <normalised orig="complaine" auto="true">complain</normalised> of her <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised> all the day, and the most part of the night in like sort, so that she <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised> <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> little rest, and disquieted them that lay <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> her.  The next day which was Wednesday, she was very ill, and when night came and supper was ended, she first fell into her sensible fit, and after that was ended, she fell into her <normalised orig="sencelesse" auto="true">senseless</normalised> fit.  Anon, fetching a great sigh, she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, Who sent for you <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised>?  He made <normalised orig="aunswere" auto="true">answer</normalised> that he was come according to his promise which he made unto her on Sunday at night.  Belike <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, you will <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> promise, but I had rather that you would <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> you away, and come when I send for you: but what <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> you brought?  I told you <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he, that I had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> a fighting the last Sunday night, but I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> had many <normalised orig="battels" auto="true">battles</normalised> since.  Yea so it <normalised orig="seemeth" auto="true">seems</normalised>, saith she, for here was both Pluck, Catch, and Blew, and they all came <normalised orig="maymed" auto="true">maimed</normalised> unto me.  Yea, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he, I have met with them all.  But I <normalised orig="marvell" auto="true">marvel</normalised>, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, that you could beat them, they are very great, and you are but a little

one.  Said he, I am good <normalised orig="ynough" auto="true">enough</normalised> for two of the best of them together.  But <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, I can tell you <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised>.  What is that, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he? They will all at one time fall upon you and beat you.  He <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, He cared not for that, he would beat two of the best of them.  And who shall beat the other two, said she?  for there is one that hath <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> many times spoken of, and he <normalised orig="carrieth" auto="true">carries</normalised> the name of Hardname, for his name <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> upon eight letters, and <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> letter <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> for a word, but what his name is we know not (<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> Hardname.)  The spirit answered, that his cosine Smacks would <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> him to beat the other two.  There are also two other Smacks as you may read in the old <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> confession.  What <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, shall your <normalised orig="cosines" auto="true">cousins</normalised> Smacks <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> you?  What, is there kindred amongst <normalised orig="diuels" auto="true">devils</normalised>?  I <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> heard of that thing before, that the <normalised orig="diuels" auto="true">devils</normalised> were <normalised orig="cosines" auto="true">cousins</normalised>.  God <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> me from that kindred.  Such like foolish <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> they had together at that time.  In the end, the spirit <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, You shall <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> no <normalised orig="moe" auto="true">more</normalised> such <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> as you have had.  No, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, that is well, but you can do nothing but lie.  Why <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he, will you not <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> me?  No, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, shall I <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, who is the father of all lies?  But you shall find it true <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he.  If I doe, then will I <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> you, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, but not before.  I pray God it be true, but whether it be true or not, I care not a rush for you.  No, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he, will you not <normalised orig="thanke" auto="true">thank</normalised> me?  <normalised orig="Thanke" auto="true">Thank</normalised> you, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, hang you and all your <normalised orig="fellowes" auto="true">fellows</normalised>, for I will not <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> you no father then I see you, neither doe I care for any of you all.

This <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> hath oftentimes gone about to win her favour, making very <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> promises to her that he would do any thing for her, if she would love him.  But it hath pleased God by the <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> of his good spirit, that she hath <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> withstood him, denying him and defying him to the uttermost, wishing all evil to light upon him and his <normalised orig="fellowes" auto="true">fellows</normalised>, for so tormenting her and her sisters without cause, <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> desiring the assistace of Gods holy spirit to <normalised orig="preserue" auto="true">preserve</normalised> her & her sisters from such temptations.  In the end, she said, You have told me many times that I should scratch Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, tell me now, when shall I scratch her?  The spirit answered, that she should scratch her before the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised>.  What said she, <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> she stad before y <normalised orig="iudges" auto="true">judges</normalised> with a <normalised orig="scratcht" auto="true">scratched</normalised> face? Yea, said the spirit, so it should be.  She answered, that she would set it on

<normalised orig="whensoeuer" auto="true">whenever</normalised> she did it: and said she, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> that you be as good as your word in this matter, for I would fain scratch her, for <normalised orig="whatsoeuer" auto="true">whatsoever</normalised> the matter is, said she, I cannot abide her now <normalised orig="adaies" auto="true">adays</normalised>, and I am sick when I <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> on her, (and so indeed she was) for <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would not suffer her willingly to stay in her <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> when she was out of her fit: and being asked the cause why, she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could not tell, for she did <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised> her no malice nor grudge in the world, neither did she <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> her any <normalised orig="euill" auto="true">evil</normalised> words, yet she said, she loathed her <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised>.  In the parting, the spirit told her that she <normalised orig="shuld" auto="true">should</normalised> have no mo fits after y <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised>.  No, said she, I am very glad of that.  But said the spirit, if you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> then, wo be to Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, for I will bring her to her end.  And thus the spirit left her, not saying any thing of his <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised>, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> presently came out of her fit, and was much better then ordinarily she used to be, and the next day she was able to go very well on her <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised>, whereof she had no use a whole <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised> before.

On <normalised orig="Munday" auto="true">Monday</normalised> next following, which was the <normalised orig="twentith" auto="true">twentieth</normalised> of <normalised orig="Februarie" auto="true">February</normalised> after supper, she began to <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, having <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> in her fit an <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised> or more before, for she had <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> her supper in her fit, with two other also of her sisters that were in their fits. On the sudden she said, What, are you come now? I had thought you would have come no more, and that we would have <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> rid of you; but where have you <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised>, said she? He answered, that his cosine <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> and he, had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> fighting with Pluck & Catch, and they had beaten them both very much, so that they dare not come to her any more. So they had very much <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> about fighting and such other matters, which before are set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>. In the end she asked when she should scratch Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>. The spirit answered, that if she would now scratch her, then her face would be whole before the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised>, which must not be. So she willed him to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> to that which he promised, for she would <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> her nails for her. Yea, saith the spirit, & she was also <normalised orig="cosenting" auto="true">consenting</normalised> to the death of the Lady Crumwel. What saith <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised>, was she also consenting to the death of Lady Crumwel? even like <normalised orig="ynough" auto="true">enough</normalised>, I thought so, saith she. Yea, saith the spirit, & to <normalised orig="proue" auto="true">prove</normalised> this to be true, <normalised orig="whensoever" auto="true">whenever</normalised> any stranger shall come into the house, you shall fall into your <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, and if then Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> shall come unto you and say, As I am a Witch, and consenting

to the death of <normalised orig="Ladie" auto="true">Lady</normalised> Crumwell, so I charge thee to depart and to let her come <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> of her fit, you shall presently well.  So <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> repeated the same words after the spirit which were then set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> in writing. If it be so, <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised> <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised>, why then I hope she <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> be hanged at the <normalised orig="assises" auto="true">assizes</normalised> as well as her mother, and that sir Henrie Crumwell will <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> to that matter. In the shutting up of the <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised>, the spirit <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> her that she should have her fits upon the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised> day, and all manner of fits which at any time she ever had, but after the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised> day she should have no mo fits, but if she had, then wo be to Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>. for then (<normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised> the spirit) I will make her pay for it

Upon <normalised orig="Fryday" auto="true">Friday</normalised> following when supper was ended, she fell into her talking fit <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> had a very <normalised orig="solemne" auto="true">solemn</normalised> <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised> an <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised> before that time.  On the <normalised orig="suddaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> where <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> you <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> all this time? and how <normalised orig="chaunce" auto="true">chance</normalised> I talked not with you <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> in my <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> times of late?  <normalised orig="Sayth" auto="true">Saith</normalised> <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised>, I was not at home, but now I bring you good <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised>.  What is that, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she?  The spirit <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, You shall <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> no <normalised orig="moe" auto="true">more</normalised> fits <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> this day <normalised orig="seuen-night" auto="true">seven-night</normalised>, if you will arise betimes to morrow morning, otherwise if you do not, you shall <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> your fit in the monring, which shall continue all the day to your trouble.  Then <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, If rising early will <normalised orig="preuent" auto="true">prevent</normalised> my fit, I will God willing, get up betimes to morrow morning; which indeed she did, and escaped her fit that day.  Then she <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> why she should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> no mo fits that <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>.  The spirit answered, that Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> him that you should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> no mo fits, <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> as I loved her: but <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> he, I love her not, yet you <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> no mo fits this <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, except some strangers come, if you will arise to morrow betimes.  And why, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, must I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> my fits if strangers come?  The spirit answered, To bring her to shame.  But when did you <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> with her, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she? <normalised orig="Euen" auto="true">Even</normalised> now <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> the spirit in the Church chamber.  She will <normalised orig="denie" auto="true">deny</normalised> that, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised>, <normalised orig="whe" auto="true">when</normalised> she is asked of it.  Yea, said the spirit, so it <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> her in hand: and you must <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> one whole week of very sick fits, said the spirit, before the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised>.  Must I, said she, for whole <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>?  Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> will <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> it so, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> the spirit.  Let me know, said she, when that day shall be.  You shall know this day <normalised orig="sennight" auto="true">seven-night</normalised> said he,

and in what sort likewise your fit shall be.  Before they parted, the spirit asked how her legs did.  She <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, well thanks be to Gd, why do you ask?  He said, because he was glad of it.  Be glad for your <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> said she, and be not glad for me, for I will <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="thanke" auto="true">thank</normalised> you for it, neither doe I <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> for you a rush, for God I trust will <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> me in <normalised orig="despight" auto="true">despite</normalised> of you.  So for that time he departed, and she came out of her fit and was very well, and so continued all the next day, arising betimes in the morning.  On Sunday following, being the 25 of <normalised orig="Februarie" auto="true">February</normalised>, M. Throgmorton of Brampton who was the first stranger y came next to the house (and is before named,) within one half <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised> after his coming, <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> into her fit, & had not long so <normalised orig="cotinued" auto="true">continued</normalised>, but Smack came to her, to whom she said, How <normalised orig="chanceth" auto="true">chances</normalised> it that I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> my fit now, and you promised that I should not <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> it before <normalised orig="Fryday" auto="true">Friday</normalised> next: He said, that she knew <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> <normalised orig="ynough" auto="true">enough</normalised>.  She said, she did not: the next: He said, that she knew <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> <normalised orig="ynough" auto="true">enough</normalised>.  She said, she did not: the he told her that strangers were come, and now she must <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> her fit to <normalised orig="proove" auto="true">prove</normalised> Agnes Samuel a witch.  Amongst other <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised>, the spirit told her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, that there was a very sore <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> of <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> fits to come ere it be long.  She <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, she cared not for it, for she hoped that God would stand with her then, as well as he had done hitherto.  As she sat thus in her fit talking with <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised>, one of her sisters sat by her, (being in a very quiet fit also) on the sudden she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>: Sister <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> (for so was the <normalised orig="childs" auto="true">child's</normalised> name that sate by her) the thing <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> me that you shall <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> a very sore fit by and by.  The words were no sooner ended, but her sister fell into a marvellous <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> and troublesome fit, swelling and <normalised orig="heauing" auto="true">heaving</normalised> in her body, <normalised orig="groning" auto="true">groaning</normalised> and crying out as their <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> was.  Then M. Throg. the <normalised orig="childs" auto="true">child's</normalised> father called for Agnes Samuel, & willed her to hold the child, for <normalised orig="saidhe" auto="true">saith</normalised>, I think you are best <normalised orig="worthie" auto="true">worthy</normalised> to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> the trouble of it.  After the child had ben in her arms <normalised orig="strugling" auto="true">struggling</normalised> & very troublesome a <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> space, her sister that before had foretold of the <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> fit she had, spake, saying, Be of good comfort sister Iane, for the thing <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> me that the worst is past, & you shall be well by and by: for the thing saith that Nan <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> is <normalised orig="werie" auto="true">weary</normalised> withholding of you, & <normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised> you <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> be well, which presently <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> true, for her troublesome fit then ended, & she continued in a very quiet fit as before.  Presently, upon this M. Throg. the <normalised orig="childs" auto="true">child's</normalised> father, told the other M. Throg. his cosine, what words his daughters

<normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> before had spoken, namely, that when any strangers came, she should thereupon fall into her fit, and then if Nan <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> should <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> such and such words, she should come <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> of her fit to <normalised orig="prooue" auto="true">prove</normalised> her a Witch.  M. Throgmorton the stranger earnestly desired to make <normalised orig="proofe" auto="true">proof</normalised> thereof.  So the <normalised orig="childs" auto="true">child's</normalised> father bad Nan <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> say after him, Even as I am a witch, and consented to the death of the Lady Crumwel, so I charge thee spirit to depart, and to let her be well.  The <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised>  began to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> them, but <normalised orig="eyther" auto="true">either</normalised> she could not, or else she would not <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> them <normalised orig="playne" auto="true">plain</normalised>, but she would <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> say, Consenting to our death of our <normalised orig="Ladie" auto="true">Lady</normalised> Crumwell; and she would not after three or <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> times repeating over, <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> the words <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised>: so that she that was in her fit <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, Here is something <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> me, that she will not <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> them aright.  In the end after much <normalised orig="adoe" auto="true">ado</normalised> she spake them, and presently she came out of her fit, and was very well.  The same words were used to another of them that then was in her fit, & prevailed as well with her as with her sister.  The next day at dinner <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Elizabeth being in her fit, was pointed unto to say grace, & when she had <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> gone through it, presently her mouth was shut up that she could not finish it.  Then M. Throg. called for Nan <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, and willed her to charge the spirit to open her mouth <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, that she might finish her grace, which the maid did, and the child went through her grace, to the end of it.  And this you should have <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> in common use amongst them, that if three or four of them had stood together <normalised orig="readie" auto="true">ready</normalised> to say grace, you should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> them all taken <normalised orig="suddainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> in their fits one after the other as they had begun to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, or at the furthest before they had spoken two lines, & their mouths also shut up, that they could not <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> at al.  Then M. Throg. laboured to teach Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> a grace of two or three lines, but he could by no <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> get her to <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> it by heart, although he caused his children to teach it her <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> times in a day.  On Thursday following which was the first of March, <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Mary, who had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> well and without any fits <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> since the Sessions day last at Huntington, was something <normalised orig="euill" auto="true">evil</normalised> at ease all the morning, and about nine of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> fell into a <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> great quaking & trembling, and could not hold a <normalised orig="ioynt" auto="true">joint</normalised> of her, yet knew no cause why.  <normalised orig="Soone" auto="true">Soon</normalised> after she was taken and fell into a <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> <normalised orig="trouble-" auto="true">trouble</normalised>

some fit, continuing therein about <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> an <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised>: in the end she waxed a little better, and said, Is it true?  do you say, This is the day wherein I must scratch the <normalised orig="yoong" auto="true">young</normalised> witch?  I am <normalised orig="hartilie" auto="true">heartily</normalised> glad of it, for I will surely pay her home, both for my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> and my sisters.  <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Edward Pickering and M. Henrie Pickering, two of the <normalised orig="childs" auto="true">child's</normalised> uncles standing by, which <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> others caused the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised> to be brought up into the chmber where the child was, to see what would be the issue of it, knowing very well that the <normalised orig="mayde" auto="true">maid</normalised> was able to <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> from scratching, if three such as the child was should set upon her at once.  So <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as the maid came into the chamber where the child was, the child <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, Art thou come thou <normalised orig="yoong" auto="true">young</normalised> Witch, who hast done all this <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised>?  The <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised> seemed to stand amazed at those words, for she was not accustomed to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> any such hard speeches from the child.  So one in the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> willed the <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised> to take up the child and <normalised orig="carrie" auto="true">carry</normalised> her down (for her <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised> were taken from her.)  <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Mary suffered her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> very quietly to be taken up in her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, and clasped her hands about her <normalised orig="necke" auto="true">neck</normalised>, but <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> as the maid began to lift up, she fell on scratching of her so eagerly and so fiercely, as that it was a <normalised orig="woonder" auto="true">wonder</normalised> to all that saw it, saying, I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> scratch you, you <normalised orig="yoong" auto="true">young</normalised> witch, and pay you home for thus punishing of me and my sisters: the thing <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> me, that I had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> well, and <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> should have had my fits any more but for you.  The <normalised orig="mayde" auto="true">maid</normalised> stood still holding down her head (for the child keeled upon her knees) and cried very <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised>, yet either would not, or could not once pluck away her head.  Nay said the child, I know you <normalised orig="crie" auto="true">cry</normalised>, but the spirit <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> that I should not <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> you, because I should not <normalised orig="pittie" auto="true">pity</normalised> you, and he is that <normalised orig="holdeth" auto="true">holds</normalised> you now that you cannot get away from me.  So the child scratched her face <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> the <normalised orig="skinne" auto="true">skin</normalised> came of, the breadth of a shiling, but there came no blood at all but water.  In the end the <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised> brought her <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> into the <normalised orig="Parlor" auto="true">Parlour</normalised>, where the child sitting a while in her <normalised orig="stoole" auto="true">stool</normalised>, seemed to be <normalised orig="woonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> <normalised orig="sorie" auto="true">sorry</normalised> for that she had done, and <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, I would not <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> scratched Nan <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, but the thing told <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> that I should doe it, and forced me there unto, stretching forth mine <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, and <normalised orig="strayning" auto="true">straining</normalised> my fingers whether I would or not, and made me to scratch her.  And truly they that saw the manner of it, and knew the mild disposition of the child, might <normalised orig="castly" auto="true">costly</normalised> see that she was overruled in the action, for she was carried with such <normalised orig="vehemencie" auto="true">vehemence</normalised> and <normalised orig="crueltie" auto="true">cruelty</normalised> for the time, against the maid, as that it appeared to be altogether besides her nature.  The child continued in her fit till an <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised> after dinner, & then being asked of these matters, was altogether ignorant of any such thing, and would not <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> it, but <normalised orig="whe" auto="true">when</normalised> she saw the example in the maids face, & being told that she had done it, she brake into <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised>, and was <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> <normalised orig="sorie" auto="true">sorry</normalised> to see it.  The next day, being Friday, <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Mary was in the very mild and solemn fit all the morning, and a little before dinner she said to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> and her sisters that were also in their fits: I am glad and <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> glad, but she wold not tel the cause why.  Presently she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> to the thing that stood by her, But I know you <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> lie to me as you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> oftertimes done.  Nay, said the thing.  I use not to lie.  No do, said she, who are you I pray you?  The thing answered, <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised>.  What said she, are you that Smack that <normalised orig="useth" auto="true">uses</normalised> to come to my sister <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised>, & <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> her so many things?  Yea, said he, saying further that he <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> told her sister <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> any lie hitherto, <normalised orig="neyther" auto="true">neither</normalised> was this a lie that he told her.  Then <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Mary declared to her sisters, being all in their fits, that which <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> had told her, which was, that after diner she should come of her fit, & <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> more <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> any fit, <normalised orig="bicause" auto="true">because</normalised> she had scratched Agnes Samuel So her sisters wished that <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> would come to them, and tell them the same.  So after dinner she came <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> of her fit, as she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, and <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> had more fits <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterword</normalised> from that day to this (thanks be to God.)  The very same day being the 2 of February <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> in the morning into her fit, & being in her bed, it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> y Smack had bin with her, & had told her <normalised orig="somthing" auto="true">something</normalised> as <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterword</normalised> she did declare to her sisters, being in their fits: for she said, I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> get up and go down, & tell some <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised>.  When she was come down into y <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised>, & had sate by y fire some <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> space, she spake on the <normalised orig="suddain" auto="true">sudden</normalised> to something y stood by her, saying: I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> not vouchsafe to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> on you, for you <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> come but you bring some ill news with you, for I was sick y last time you were here, and I <normalised orig="maruel" auto="true">marvel</normalised> who sent for you now?  The thing answered her, You were sick in deed the last time I was here, but now you <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> be much worse.  Why do your worst said she, for I <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> not for you (seeming to speak very <normalised orig="angerly" auto="true">angrily</normalised> to him) for God, said she, <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised>

<normalised orig="preserue" auto="true">preserve</normalised> me, I <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> you not.  I <normalised orig="maruell" auto="true">marvel</normalised> said she how your <normalised orig="legge" auto="true">leg</normalised> both?  I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> spoke with you when he brake your leg, Yea said he, I pray you do not tel Smack that I was here: do you pray me? said she, I do not know that Smack, but if I did, I wold surely tell him, that he might <normalised orig="breake" auto="true">break</normalised> your <normalised orig="necke" auto="true">neck</normalised> also.  The thing answered, yes you know him well <normalised orig="inough" auto="true">enough</normalised>, for you made him break my leg, but I would not for any thing, that he should know that I was here said y thing, but I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> make you <normalised orig="paie" auto="true">pay</normalised> for all this <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> that <normalised orig="commeth" auto="true">comes</normalised> in.  Will you? saith she, I will <normalised orig="laye" auto="true">lay</normalised> with you what you <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised>, that I <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> not be sick this week if I list, for one thing that I know.  Yea saith he.  I <normalised orig="knowe" auto="true">know</normalised> very well that <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> was with you this morning, but do both of you what you can, you <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> a <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> of it, & that you <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> find, <normalised orig="fo" auto="true">foe</normalised> you <normalised orig="shalbe" auto="true">shall be</normalised> so <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> this next <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, that your body <normalised orig="shalbe" auto="true">shall be</normalised> sore al the next <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> after, for I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> course you, <normalised orig="aswel" auto="true">as well</normalised> as <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> hath coursed me.  Why said she, do you <normalised orig="reuenge" auto="true">revenge</normalised> your <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> upon me and not upon <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised>? He said that he durst not <normalised orig="deale" auto="true">deal</normalised> with him, for he was too hard for him.

After a little silence betwixt them, she asked her sisters, that were likewise in their <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, if they did not see <normalised orig="Catche" auto="true">Catch</normalised> who talked with her <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> now?  They answered no Why then <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, belike he is gone, for neither do I see him, then <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="begunne" auto="true">begun</normalised> to <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> softly with them, as if no <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> should <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> them, saying, that <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> was with her in the monring when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was in her <normalised orig="bedde" auto="true">bed</normalised>, and told her that this next <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> will be a <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> to her, which he could not <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised>, but he did so <normalised orig="beate" auto="true">beat</normalised> <normalised orig="Plucke" auto="true">Pluck</normalised> as he told me, that he <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> come at me <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and if <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> he <normalised orig="commeth" auto="true">comes</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, then he saith he will kill him: but he said to me, if you will <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to some <normalised orig="friendes" auto="true">friends</normalised> house, and <normalised orig="staie" auto="true">stay</normalised> there all the <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, then you shall be well, and escape this <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>: but I <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> him <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she, that I had no friends house to go unto, nor to none I would go to, do he what he wold, then he willed me to go to Sommersom (which is a town two miles from Warbois) where <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> she hath bin, with an uncle of hers, since her first visitation in this sort, & bin very well, but I marue said she, how he <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> Sommersom, I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> he <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> all the <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised> over, but I <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> him that I would not once <normalised orig="stirre" auto="true">stir</normalised> my <normalised orig="foote" auto="true">foot</normalised> out of the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> for him, do he what he
could.  Then her sisters asked <normalised orig="whe" auto="true">when</normalised> Smack would come again.  She said, that he told her, that he would come <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> at night after supper.  In the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> time <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> strangers came in, who were desirous to see her out of her fit, which was done by the charge of Agnes Samuel.  Namely, as she was a Witch & consented to the death of the Lady Crumwell, &c.  At night a <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> before supper she fell into her it again, & so continued <normalised orig="til" auto="true">till</normalised> supper was ended.  When the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> were risen from the <normalised orig="boord" auto="true">board</normalised>, and set by the fire, Smack came to her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and talked with her about those fits, which she should have the next <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, saying that he could not do <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>, except she would go from home.  She said that she would not, and <normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised> willed him to do his worst.   Then said he, when was Catch with you? She told him y Catch was there to day, & <normalised orig="threatned" auto="true">threatened</normalised> to punish her y next week with wonderful sick fits, because he said, y I had caused you to <normalised orig="breake" auto="true">break</normalised> his leg, but I hope said she, that you <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> break his neck also, & some body will break yours, for you are all nought.  Smack answered, that he would course Catchfor it, & warrant her that he would <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> come again to her when he had done with him.  Then said she, tell me when shall my fits begin, & when <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> they end?  He said, y on muday next in y morning they must begin, & end that day <normalised orig="sennight" auto="true">seven-night</normalised> in y morning.  You will <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> a whole week belike (said she) yea said he, it must be so, & you <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> be sore in your body y next <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> after.  On <normalised orig="Saterday" auto="true">Saturday</normalised> which was the next day, she had <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, and was brought out of them by Agnes Samuels charge, and so likewise on the Sunday.  When <normalised orig="Munday" auto="true">Monday</normalised> came which was the day appointed for y beginning of these troublesome fits, it kept promise with her, for in the morning she wared marvellous <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> & <normalised orig="euill" auto="true">evil</normalised> at ease, <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> her perfect <normalised orig="sences" auto="true">senses</normalised>, as it was also foretold that she should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised>, and so continued all the <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>: the manner whereof, hereafter shall be declared, because certain accidents worthy the remembrance befell some other of her sisters in this <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, which shall first <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> their place.

<normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Elizabeth one of these children and before spoken of, was all this week troubled with very <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> and extraordinary fits, for she was twitched and <normalised orig="wroong" auto="true">wrong</normalised> in her body more <normalised orig="greeuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> this <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, then she was many <normalised orig="moneths" auto="true">months</normalised> before, which violent passions in her, made us <normalised orig="coniecture" auto="true">conjecture</normalised>, that there was some extraordinary matter in working: for it could not be that such violence should continue long, for if it had, it could not but <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> cost her her life.  And to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> matters of <normalised orig="strangenesse" auto="true">strangeness</normalised>, which befell in that <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, we will come to <normalised orig="Saterday" auto="true">Saturday</normalised>, which was the tenth of March: on which day as this child sate at supper, it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> by the manifold <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> she made with her <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised> and head, and by her humming with her <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised>, that she would <normalised orig="faine" auto="true">fine</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> spoken to something that stood on the table, but she could not, her mouth was shut up.  Then she began to lament <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> bitterly a good space, yet could not declare her <normalised orig="greefe" auto="true">grief</normalised>.  <normalised orig="Soone" auto="true">Soon</normalised> after, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> fell into a most troublesome fit, which would not suffer her to sit on her <normalised orig="stoole" auto="true">stool</normalised>.  Then the <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised> Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, was willed to hold her, which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did: and after a while she <normalised orig="beganne" auto="true">began</normalised> to <normalised orig="growe" auto="true">grow</normalised> more quiet.  And an other of her sisters younger then she, Grace by name, was more troubled than she was, so Nan <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> let <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> the one, and <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> up the other, and as she was holding this <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Grace in her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, the other child <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Elizabeth that sat hard by her, said on the sudden in a <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> anger to her, now I can see the <normalised orig="yong" auto="true">young</normalised> Witch which I could <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> do before since she came to the house in my fit.  The copany that sate at supper, thought that there was some extraordinary matter in working, that the child should call the <normalised orig="yong" auto="true">young</normalised> maid Witch, for it was <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> heard by any body, that <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> she <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> either her or her mother, any <normalised orig="euill" auto="true">evil</normalised> word before, either in her fit or out of her fit: presently she said to her, my sister <normalised orig="Ioanes" auto="true">Joins</normalised> <normalised orig="diuel" auto="true">devil</normalised> told me <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> now as I sate at supper, that I must scratch the <normalised orig="yong" auto="true">young</normalised> Witch.  So <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as <normalised orig="eue" auto="true">eve</normalised> she had <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> so, she slipped from the bench whereon she sat, and fell upon her kees, for she was not able to stand, and caught the <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised> by the hand that stood hard by her, holding of her sister, and scratched one of her <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised> most fiercely to see, with both her hands, and saying that it was she that had bewitched her and all her sisters, and she had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> well long since but for her.  O thou <normalised orig="yong" auto="true">young</normalised> With, O tho <normalised orig="yong" auto="true">young</normalised> Witch, fie upon thee, fie upon thee, who <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> heard of a <normalised orig="yong" auto="true">young</normalised> Witch before? and thus she <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> with such <normalised orig="vehemencie" auto="true">vehemence</normalised> of speech, and <normalised orig="eagernesse" auto="true">eagerness</normalised> of scratching, as that both her breath and strength <normalised orig="fayled" auto="true">failed</normalised> her.  When she had breathed a while, she fell upon her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and said that this was her

sister <normalised orig="Ioanes" auto="true">Joins</normalised> <normalised orig="diuel" auto="true">devil</normalised> who <normalised orig="useth" auto="true">uses</normalised> not to lye, that made her to scratch her, for said she, I would not <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> scratched you, and it was full <normalised orig="euil" auto="true">evil</normalised> against my will to do it, but the <normalised orig="diuel" auto="true">devil</normalised> <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised> me to scratch you, stretching forth mine <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, & bending my fingers, otherwise I would not do it, but I must do it, and so must all my sisters scratch you, though they be <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> so unwilling to do it, as my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> now am, these words she uttered and many <normalised orig="moe" auto="true">more</normalised>, to the like effect, in that time wherein she scratched her.  All this time the <normalised orig="mayde" auto="true">maid</normalised> held the other <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> in her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> still, <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> once offering to <normalised orig="plucke" auto="true">pluck</normalised> away her hand from her, but cried out <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised>, desiring the Lord to <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her.  Then did one that stood by, <normalised orig="demaund" auto="true">demand</normalised> of her, and willed her to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> her <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> as she thought, whether the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> did scratch her of her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> will and desire or not.  She answered, that she thought she did not, nay saith she, I know she did not, and that it is no part of her will thus to scratch me.  The <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> when she was weary the second time with scratching of her, on the <normalised orig="suddaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> put forth both her <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised>, and said <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> you here, the <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised> saith, that I must scratch her no more now, for my fingers are thrust <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> so straight, that I cannot bend them, and so it appeared that they were, for she held <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> her hand, and her fingers were <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> straight and <normalised orig="stiffe" auto="true">stiff</normalised>, then she rubbed her hand upon the <normalised orig="maydes" auto="true">maids</normalised> hand that bled a little, and wiped the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> upon her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> hands, and this the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> did oftentimes, while she talked with her.  Presently <normalised orig="uppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the scratching ended, the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> <normalised orig="beganne" auto="true">began</normalised> to <normalised orig="weepe" auto="true">weep</normalised>, insomuch that many <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised> fell from her eyes, and <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> bitterly, and <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> to the <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised>, I would not in any wise <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> scratched you, but the <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised> made me, and forced me whether I would or not, oh that you <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> had <normalised orig="deserued" auto="true">deserved</normalised> to be thus used, and her <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of complaining was, as if she had committed some great offence.  When this weeping fit was something <normalised orig="asswaged" auto="true">assuaged</normalised>, she <normalised orig="beganne" auto="true">began</normalised> to exhort her, lifting up her <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> with such <normalised orig="vehemencie" auto="true">vehemence</normalised> and desire for her amendment, as that we may verily <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised>, the like was <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> heard to come forth of a childes mouth.  It is not possible to set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> all the <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> of exhortation she spake unto the <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised> at that <normalised orig="tyme" auto="true">time</normalised>, but these were some of them, and the <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> so <normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> as could be <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised>.  Oh that thou <normalised orig="hadst" auto="true">had</normalised>

grace to repent thee of thy <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>, that thy <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> might be <normalised orig="saued" auto="true">saved</normalised>: for thou hast forsaken thy God, and <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> thy <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> to the <normalised orig="deuill" auto="true">devil</normalised>.  Oh that thou <normalised orig="diddest" auto="true">did</normalised> <normalised orig="knowe" auto="true">know</normalised> what a precious thing thy <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> was, thou <normalised orig="woulst" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> then so lightly <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> parted with it: thou <normalised orig="hadst" auto="true">had</normalised> <normalised orig="neede" auto="true">need</normalised> to pray night and day, to get Gods <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, otherwise they <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> shall be damned in hell fire for ever.  Thou doest oftentimes pray here at home, when we pray, and likewise at Church, but thou <normalised orig="prayest" auto="true">pray</normalised> in <normalised orig="vaine" auto="true">vain</normalised>, because thou <normalised orig="prayest" auto="true">pray</normalised> not with thy heart: but I will pray for thee with all mine heart, and I will forgive thee, and desire all my sisters, & all my friends to forgive thee, if tho wilst <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> thy fault, but thou hast an hard hart (<normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she) and the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> <normalised orig="holdeth" auto="true">holds</normalised> thy hart and will not suffer thee to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it, but thou must <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it whether thou wilt or no, when thy time is come.  But oh that thou <normalised orig="wouldest" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="nowe" auto="true">now</normalised> <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it, that thy <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> might bee saved.  These <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> when she used them (as she did often) she would three times at the least <normalised orig="repeate" auto="true">repeat</normalised> them over, with such <normalised orig="vehemency" auto="true">vehemence</normalised>, as that it was <normalised orig="straunge" auto="true">strange</normalised> to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>, for she would never leave uttering of them so long as her breath would serve.  Then did she tell my sister <normalised orig="Joanes" auto="true">Joins</normalised> <normalised orig="devill" auto="true">devil</normalised> <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> here before my face, and pointed with her finger to the place, and <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> me that in <normalised orig="despight" auto="true">despite</normalised> of thee thou shalt one day <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it, or be hanged, we <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> not be well: but if thou <normalised orig="wouldest" auto="true">would</normalised> even now <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it, we shall be presently well, <normalised orig="defie" auto="true">defy</normalised> now therefore the <normalised orig="devill" auto="true">devil</normalised>, and <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> it, that God may forgive thee, and that they <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> may be saved.  If thou <normalised orig="wouldest" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> (<normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she) of the torments of hell, and that thy <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> must burned in hell fire, except thou doest <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> and repent, then thou <normalised orig="wouldest" auto="true">would</normalised> not now stand so <normalised orig="stifly" auto="true">stiffly</normalised> in the <normalised orig="deniall" auto="true">denial</normalised> of it as thou doest: but thou art a wicked <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, and thou hast <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a Witch this <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> or five <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> & more, thou hast done more hurt the to me and my sisters, for tho hast killed my <normalised orig="Ladie" auto="true">Lady</normalised> Crumwell and <normalised orig="moe" auto="true">more</normalised>.  The <normalised orig="devill" auto="true">devil</normalised> that <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> here <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> me so, and thou <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> it have killed my sister Joane in this her sick <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, but God will not let thee, what a wicked hart hast thou that nothing will content thee but our death, thou, and thy father (<normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised> she) were the cause why thy mother did deny that, which she did once <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>, she was in a good way, and would
<normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> have gone from her <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>, had not you and your father bin, & if your mothers <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> be <normalised orig="damyned" auto="true">dominated</normalised>, you & your father must <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> for it, with many such like speeches, for your mother (<normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> she) had confessed a truth, and was sorry for her <normalised orig="naughtinesse" auto="true">naughtiness</normalised>, every body had forgiven her, and would have prayed for her: oh that she had <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> gone home, that her <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> might <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> been saved, thy mother is a witch, thy father is a witch, and thou art a witch, but of all the three thou art the worst.  Thy mother would never have done so much hurt as she hath done, but for thee, and so the <normalised orig="devill" auto="true">devil</normalised> hath <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> me, thou wicked <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, thou art a wicked child, the Lord give thee grace to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>, and to repent that thy <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> may be <normalised orig="saued" auto="true">saved</normalised>.  Oh that they father were now here, for the <normalised orig="devill" auto="true">devil</normalised> now <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised>, that I should scratch him also, he is a witch and a <normalised orig="naughtie" auto="true">naughty</normalised> man, Oh that he were here, that he might <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> me now <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> to him.

Then two of the childes Uncles, M. John Pickering, and M. Henrie Pickering, being there present were <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> of the childes father to see if they could by any <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised>, procure <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> to come to the house, but it was thought by the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> to be a labour lost before they went, the man was of so churlish a nature, and <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> so hardly <normalised orig="drawne" auto="true">drawn</normalised> to the house: notwithstanding they went, and when they had gone <normalised orig="twentie" auto="true">twenty</normalised> paces from the house, they did <normalised orig="perceiue" auto="true">perceive</normalised> the same man to be cumming alone very fast <normalised orig="towardes" auto="true">towards</normalised> the house, so they agreed to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> by him in silence, to see whether he <normalised orig="ment" auto="true">meant</normalised> to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>, the man went directly to M. Throckmortons house, which they perceiving, followed him <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and were as <normalised orig="redie" auto="true">ready</normalised> to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> into the house as he, when they were come into the hall, and were even at the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> <normalised orig="readie" auto="true">ready</normalised> to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> intot he <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised> where the child and other <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> were: the child <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> of her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, he is come, he is come, I will <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> scratch him, so she pressed <normalised orig="forwardes" auto="true">forwards</normalised> on her knees (for she had no use of her <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised>) towards the <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised> <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> as if she would go to him, yet this is most <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised>, that she was the in such a place of the <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised> as that she could not see any part of the hall, and therefore not the man.  Then M. Doctor Dorington being in presence, <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised> the child so to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> on her knees, stayed her, and caused the man to be called into the <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised>, when he came in, she still pressed to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> <normalised orig="towardes" auto="true">towards</normalised> him, and

<normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> I must scratch him, I must scratch him, on the <normalised orig="suddaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> she stopped sayin, I must not scratch him, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> you here & <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> her hands how her fingers were shut up close together, if he had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> here even now (<normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised> she) the <normalised orig="devill" auto="true">devil</normalised> <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised> I should have scratched him, but now I must not.  Then M. Thockmorton the childes Father, <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> of the man John <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, why he came to his house, he answered that one in the <normalised orig="feld" auto="true">field</normalised> told him that his daughter was <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> and therefore he came.  Then Master Trockmorton and M. Doctor Dorington charged him to tell the truth wh o it was and not to lye, as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> it, he answered that he would not tell them, notwithstanding they urged him, at length he <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, that his brothers daughter came to his house and <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> him, that she saw M. Doctor Dorington and M. Throckmortons man come to this house together, and then he thinking that there was some thing to doe about his daughter, came <normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised> to see the matter, but this was thought of the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> to be no sufficient cause to bring him to the house, whereas before <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> could not be gotten to come without a precept from the Justices.  The child continued still crying out upon him & <normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised>, that he was a <normalised orig="naughtie" auto="true">naughty</normalised> man, and a witch, and but for him & his daughter, his wives <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> might have <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> saved, and therefore <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> must <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> for it before God one day, and so repeated over <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> many of her speeches to him, which before she had said to his daughter exhorting him to prayers, and to <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> God <normalised orig="forgivenes" auto="true">forgiveness</normalised>.  The man was so rude in his behaviour, and so <normalised orig="lowd" auto="true">loud</normalised> in his speeches that the child could not be heard for him: His <normalised orig="answeres" auto="true">answers</normalised> to the child were, that she <normalised orig="lyed" auto="true">lied</normalised>, and so did all the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> in saying he was a witch, and he <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> taught her lessons well enough, and that she was above seven <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> (though <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised> she was not twice seven) with many such like speeches, and would not be silent nor suffer the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> for any thing <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> he was almost forced unto it by the childes father, although he might <normalised orig="perceiue" auto="true">perceive</normalised> very well, as also did all the company, that the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> could not <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> him, nor <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> to any of his speeches, either yet stayed her <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> at his talking, in any thing she intended to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> to him, although he greatly interrupted the same, if she could have heard him, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> neither heard him nor <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised>
other in the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised>, yet she <normalised orig="sawe" auto="true">saw</normalised> him and his daughter, and not any other.  <normalised orig="Towardes" auto="true">Towards</normalised> the end when the child had thus exhorted the father and the daughter for the space of an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> and an <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised>, M. Throckmorton the childes father, <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> the man John <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, that his daughter Agnes, by a charge which she had, commanded the <normalised orig="spirites" auto="true">spirits</normalised> to depart from his childen, & they had departed, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> therefore willed him to use the same <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> which his daughter before had used, to see what would come of it: he <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> that he would not, <normalised orig="neyther" auto="true">neither</normalised> should any make him to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> them, and he would not be brought to it for any thing.  Then did Master Throckmorton tell him that seeing <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> came to his house unsent for, he should not depart <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> he had spoken them, so long as the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> continued in her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, if it were this <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> before she came <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised>.  Then did M. Doctor Dorington (the rather to bring him on) <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> the words before him, so did also two or three of his neighbours, honest men in the <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised>, that were then present and saw al these matters in the child, but this would not <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> the man, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> in the end, he <normalised orig="perceyved" auto="true">perceived</normalised> that Master Throckmorton was resolute, not to suffer him to depart <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> he had spoken them, then he <normalised orig="begunne" auto="true">begun</normalised> to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> them as he was taught by Master Throckmorton, the <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> were these, as I am a Witch, and consenting to the death of the Lady Crumwell, so I charge the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> to depart from <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Elizabeth Throckmorton at this present, and to suffer her to be well, the man had no sooner spoken the words, but the child presently arose, and was very well, <normalised orig="marueyling" auto="true">marvelling</normalised> to see such <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> there.  Then was the child asked if she <normalised orig="knewe" auto="true">knew</normalised> of any thing which she had done or <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, and <normalised orig="diuerse" auto="true">diverse</normalised> <normalised orig="perticulers" auto="true">particulars</normalised> were named unto her, but she knew of no such thing, saying that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised>, and was <normalised orig="readie" auto="true">ready</normalised> to <normalised orig="weepe" auto="true">weep</normalised> because they charged her with such things, so the company departed, and she went to bed being very well.

It now <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised> to declare how <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> Throckmorton was handled in this present <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> past, which was that <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> of sitters threatened to her before by the spirit.  On Sunday which was the day before, she was lightsome, and had no fit at all, saying that she was very well, yet no body would tell her of the <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> fits which was threatened to befall her the
next day, so she went to <normalised orig="bede" auto="true">bed</normalised> very <normalised orig="merrie" auto="true">merry</normalised> and <normalised orig="chearefull" auto="true">cheerful</normalised>, saying that she <normalised orig="ayled" auto="true">ailed</normalised> nothing at all, she thanked God: The next morning which was <normalised orig="Munday" auto="true">Monday</normalised>, when she awakened there was found a great change in her head and <normalised orig="stomacke" auto="true">stomach</normalised>, and that there was some thing under her sides, which did so twitch and wring her, that she could not fetch her breath. All that day, as likewise all that <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> following she was most <normalised orig="straungly" auto="true">strangely</normalised> tormented, crying out of extreme payne in all her parts of her, her <normalised orig="stomacke" auto="true">stomach</normalised> was taken from her, so that she <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> all that <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> scarcely so much as might be thought sufficient to <normalised orig="susteine" auto="true">sustain</normalised> nature, her <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised> were exceeding sore, and full of <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised>, having <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> or no use of them all that <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, her hands were continually <normalised orig="colde" auto="true">cold</normalised>, and <normalised orig="benummed" auto="true">benumbed</normalised>, but her greatest and continual <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> lay in her head, which caused her to take <normalised orig="marueilous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> unquiet rest, for she did nothing but cry and <normalised orig="grone" auto="true">groan</normalised> the most part of the nights throughout that <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> neither resting her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> nor suffering any others to rest, that lay <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> her: Now besides this <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> and <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> in her body, she had divers fits <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> day, and likewise in the night time, such as wherein no man that saw her, thought she should have escaped with her life: for she would lye upon her bed scriking and suddenly starting an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> <normalised orig="togeather" auto="true">together</normalised>, and <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> <normalised orig="fower" auto="true">four</normalised> or five <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised> without any intermission, otherwiles <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="ly" auto="true">lie</normalised> as one in a <normalised orig="Sowne" auto="true">Sown</normalised> or <normalised orig="Traunce" auto="true">Trance</normalised> holding her breath a quarter of an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> and sometimes longer, in such <normalised orig="sorte" auto="true">sort</normalised> as that it could neither be felt nor perceived that she breathed at all for the time, yet in the end she would arise up with her belly and fetch a marveilous <normalised orig="deepe" auto="true">deep</normalised> sigh, and a <normalised orig="lowd" auto="true">loud</normalised> doleful <normalised orig="grone" auto="true">groan</normalised> as if she had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> gasping for her last breath: And this <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of fit was most <normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised> with her night and day, and would hold her the longest of any other, and <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> the longer when any of her <normalised orig="freinds" auto="true">friends</normalised> or other company <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> by and comforted her, some times it would rise up into her head, and their resting a while, it would <normalised orig="rayse" auto="true">raise</normalised> up her body, and her head very strongly, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> almost she <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> upright, yet with such strength, as that it was not possible for any man to hold her <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>.  In which fit she was desirous to have her head holden, otherwise she said that it

would rine her head in sunder, and <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> a little before she felt the fit <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised>, she would say hold, and all the while <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was in rising with her body, it would <normalised orig="holde" auto="true">hold</normalised> her breath, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> she came to the highest, and then would she fetch a great gone, and with a sudden <normalised orig="downefall" auto="true">downfall</normalised>, settle her self in the <normalised orig="chaire" auto="true">chair</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and how soever all the <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> she was in this <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> <normalised orig="daunger" auto="true">danger</normalised> and had her life in her <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised> <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> ready to <normalised orig="yeelde" auto="true">yield</normalised> it up, yet on Saturday all the day long, but especially in the night she was in the greatest hazard thereof, for then did her parents, & other that wished well unto her, <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> that she should never have <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> the daylight: such and so many were her <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> fits and <normalised orig="daungerous" auto="true">dangerous</normalised> perplerities in that night, but it pleased God, a <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> before morning to give her some better rest, and this was some good hope, and comfort that her parents and other her <normalised orig="freindes" auto="true">friends</normalised> had in respect in the <normalised orig="safetie" auto="true">safety</normalised> of her life, for that both she her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, and other also of her sisters had heretofore <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> being in their fits, that Nan Samull would have had the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> to kill her this <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, as she hath done the Lady Crumwell but God <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> not suffer him.  But in all these extremeities this is most <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised>, that all the <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> long she had the perfect use of her <normalised orig="sences" auto="true">senses</normalised> as the spirit had told her that she should have, and was able to <normalised orig="discerne" auto="true">discern</normalised> one thing from an other, and to make <normalised orig="answeare" auto="true">answer</normalised> to any question that was asked at any time (except then when her breath was stopped and while she continued as one in a <normalised orig="sowne" auto="true">sown</normalised>,) but being asked afterwards if she then heard, she answered that she did <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>, but she could not sometimes <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, because her breath was stopped.  And this was a thing noted in her that <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, that she could <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> abide that Nan <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> should abide in her company, or come into her sight or once to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> her named, yet she would say, that she could not tell for what cause it was, but it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> there was some secret matter in it, for <normalised orig="whensoever" auto="true">whenever</normalised>, and how long soever, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> stayed with her she was <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> the more strongly <normalised orig="delt" auto="true">dealt</normalised> with all and the more <normalised orig="greiuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> troubled.

When the sennite was ended, and <normalised orig="Munday" auto="true">Monday</normalised> morning came <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, she said that she felt her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> reasonable well, and all that day she had no fit at all, <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> she said, that she was very sore in her body & in her <normalised orig="leggs" auto="true">legs</normalised>, as if she had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> beaten with strockes.
All this <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> following she continued reasonable well, yet not without many fits and great <normalised orig="sorenes" auto="true">soreness</normalised> in her <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised>, especially towards night as it was common with them all to be <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> worst at night.

On <normalised orig="Munday" auto="true">Monday</normalised> after that which was the 19. of March a little before supper she fell into her fit, and when supper was ended <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> came unto her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, to whom she presently said, I trust God will one day revenge me on you, and all your company, for thus punishing of me and my Sisters: why said he, had you a <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> of it?  It is no matter to you said she: why I <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> you said he, that I could not <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> it, except you would have gone abroad to some <normalised orig="friendes" auto="true">friends</normalised> house, <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> you <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> she whether you will, and doe what you can, I will not once <normalised orig="stur" auto="true">stir</normalised> my <normalised orig="foote" auto="true">foot</normalised> out of <normalised orig="doores" auto="true">doors</normalised> for your pleasure, for I know you would kill me if you could, and you use all the <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> you can both to kill me and my Sisters, but I trust God will not give you leave & if he doth I am well contented <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>, for I had rather be dead then to live in this continual <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised>, and not able to stand or <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>: many <normalised orig="moe" auto="true">more</normalised> such like <normalised orig="speaches" auto="true">speeches</normalised> they had <normalised orig="togeather" auto="true">together</normalised>; anon she <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, you have often times <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> me, that I should scratch the <normalised orig="younge" auto="true">young</normalised> witch, before the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised>, now tell me when shall it be?  For I would <normalised orig="faine" auto="true">fine</normalised> scratch her, I cannot abide her now of late, whatsoever the matter is, I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> God hath set my hart against her, for I cannot <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> my <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised>, if she <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> before me, it so <normalised orig="goeth" auto="true">goes</normalised> against my <normalised orig="stomacke" auto="true">stomach</normalised>, and yet I cannot tell wherefore, but tell me said she on what day shall I scratch her, he <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> her that she should scratch her two or three <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> before the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised>, tell me said she, on which day shall it be?  For I will never <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> you, he <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> her that it should bee on <normalised orig="Munday" auto="true">Monday</normalised> before the Assisses which was that day fortnight: well said she, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> that it be, for I will <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> my <normalised orig="nayles" auto="true">nails</normalised> unpared for her, I will scratch on side for my self said she and the other for mine <normalised orig="Aunte" auto="true">Aunt</normalised> Pickering, this her <normalised orig="Aunte" auto="true">Aunt</normalised> is wife to M. Iohn Pickering of Ellington in the <normalised orig="countie" auto="true">county</normalised> of Huntington, who was one of the twelve, that were bewitched, and hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> most <normalised orig="grieuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> tormented with <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> and breaking out in her <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised>, as that she is not able to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>, well <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> to <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised>, I will surely lay it an <normalised orig="whensoever" auto="true">whenever</normalised> I scratch her, that all the world may see that
she is a witch: Then said <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised>, they that <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> otherwise of her are <normalised orig="deceiued" auto="true">deceived</normalised>, and that I will <normalised orig="proue" auto="true">prove</normalised>: Will you <normalised orig="proue" auto="true">prove</normalised> it? Said she, how will you <normalised orig="proue" auto="true">prove</normalised> it?  By compelling you to scratch her: will you <normalised orig="compell" auto="true">compel</normalised> me?  Said she, why then I will not scratch her: but you shall scratch her said he: so they had many <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> about it, in thend she <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> that <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised> she had a good will to scratch her, but yet she will not scratch her if she can otherwise choose, but <normalised orig="Smacke" auto="true">Smack</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> that she must scratch her <normalised orig="aswell" auto="true">as well</normalised> as all her other Sisters had done and must doe, for there are yet two behind that must scratch her.  When they had ended their <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised>, she called for Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> and said that she should not come forth of her fit, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> she had charged the spirit to <normalised orig="departe" auto="true">depart</normalised>, which the <normalised orig="mayde" auto="true">maid</normalised> did, and she was presently well.  Within two <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> after.  <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Grace the youngest of all those five sisters, as she sat in the <normalised orig="maides" auto="true">maids</normalised> <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, in a very troublesome fit, on the <normalised orig="suddaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> fell on scratching of the <normalised orig="maides" auto="true">maids</normalised> hand, merveilous fiercely to see, but was not able to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, her mouth was shut up: yet did she <normalised orig="grone" auto="true">groan</normalised> and <normalised orig="weepe" auto="true">weep</normalised> greatly as if she had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> doing of some thing against her will, but such was the childes short <normalised orig="nayles" auto="true">nails</normalised> and want of strength, that she could not once ripple the <normalised orig="skinne" auto="true">skin</normalised> of the <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> of her hands.  Of this child there are not many things noted, because for the most part her mouth was shut up during the time of her fits, yet had she very many most grevious and troublesome fits: for she hath sit in a <normalised orig="chaire" auto="true">chair</normalised>, or on a <normalised orig="stoole" auto="true">stool</normalised> by the fire side, some times a whole day <normalised orig="togeather" auto="true">together</normalised>, <normalised orig="groning" auto="true">groaning</normalised> and weeping most lamentable to see, and was never <normalised orig="cleare" auto="true">clear</normalised> from her fits since the first beginning.

Throckmortons children save one, and hath <normalised orig="druncke" auto="true">drunk</normalised> as <normalised orig="deepe" auto="true">deep</normalised> of this cup of affliction as any of all her sisters hath done, and as she first talked of it, so she was the first that disliked, and disclosed the author of it, for she it was that first cried out of mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, and said that it was she that had <normalised orig="bewitche" auto="true">bewitch</normalised> her, before either her parents or any other that came towards her, suspected any <normalised orig="witcherie" auto="true">witchery</normalised> et al, since which time as there hath <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> great cause to <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised>, that whereas she was the first that gave occasion to suspect the old woman, and indeed did her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> openly accuse her, so she hath <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> therefore amongst all the rest, the most <normalised orig="extreamely" auto="true">extremely</normalised> <normalised orig="delt" auto="true">dealt</normalised> <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>: for there was never any of her sisters, (<normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> excepted) y did abide such <normalised orig="heavie" auto="true">heavy</normalised> brunts, such <normalised orig="daungerous" auto="true">dangerous</normalised> and <normalised orig="mortall" auto="true">mortal</normalised> temptations, as she hath done, for she hath <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> often and divers times tempted to cast her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> into the fire, and into the water, and to deprive her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> of life by cutting her <normalised orig="throate" auto="true">throat</normalised> with her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> knife.  And these things have thus appeared in her, namely, that she hath many times in her <normalised orig="fitts" auto="true">fits</normalised>, suddenly pulled the knife out of her sheath, and if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> hath <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="abroade" auto="true">abroad</normalised>, she hath <normalised orig="throwne" auto="true">thrown</normalised> it from her so far as she <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised>: if within the house sitting at the table or in any other place, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> hath <normalised orig="throwne" auto="true">thrown</normalised> it under the table or in some corner of the house, saying that the spirit doth now tempt her to kill her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, but she will not, desiring the Lord to strengthen her against them, and when she hath come out of her fit, she hath acknowledged no such matter, marvelling who hath taken her knife from her, and for the <normalised orig="daunger" auto="true">danger</normalised> of fire, this thing hath also <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> proved many times in her: for she hath pressed forwards, and strained her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> to thrust her head into the fire, and hath <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> permitted to come so <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> the fire with her head and face, that resting <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> upon the strength of one that did withhold her, had she <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> let <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>, she had fallen flat into the fire, to her utter danger of perishing <normalised orig="therin" auto="true">therein</normalised>, and the same experience in her, hath as often <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> made by water, saying <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> that the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> doth tempt her to both: yet this hath <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> observed continually in all these temptations that she was never tempted to any of these <normalised orig="daungers" auto="true">dangers</normalised>, (that ever was <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised>) being alone, but <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> when there were some company and assistance by to <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> her: which thing thus considered, whether it hath proceeded of the gracious providence and <normalised orig="goodnesse" auto="true">goodness</normalised> of God, which cannot be denied but that it hath <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> most <normalised orig="straunge" auto="true">strange</normalised> and most <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised>, both in the preservation of her, as also in the rest of her sisters in these their troublesome extremities, or whether it hath <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> some secret illusio, and

mockery of the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> to deceive the standers by, it <normalised orig="resteth" auto="true">rests</normalised> <normalised orig="doubtfull" auto="true">doubtful</normalised>, and cannot be determined amongst men, but whether one or the other, or whatsoever, god <normalised orig="deserveth" auto="true">deserves</normalised> the glory.

 

Upon Friday which was the 15. of march 1592.  This <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Iane was very much troubled, with her fit

On Friday, which was the fifteenth of March 1592, this Mistress Jane was very much troubled with her fit, sitting at the table in dinner time, as she had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> for a fortnight or three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> before that, more <normalised orig="extreamely" auto="true">extremely</normalised> used at <normalised orig="meales" auto="true">meals</normalised>, then at any other time of the day, for <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> a little before she should sit <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> either in <normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> of thanks, or presently after her fit would surely take her.  On this day as she sat at dinner, she seemed that some thing that sat upon the table, talked unto her about Nan <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, for she would listen a while unto it, and then <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> with an <normalised orig="heavie" auto="true">heavy</normalised> countenance unto the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised>, that <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> <normalised orig="behinde" auto="true">behind</normalised> her, shaking her head as if some <normalised orig="sorow" auto="true">sorrow</normalised> were towards.  Now this <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Iane had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> often <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised>, by her other sisters being in their <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, that the spirit had <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> them, that she <normalised orig="shold" auto="true">should</normalised> also scratch Nan <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> before the next <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised>, happen when it should, but she would <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> make this <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> to them, that she would not scratch her, let the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> doe what he could against her, albeit the spirit had <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> so much to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had oftetimes <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, but she <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> <normalised orig="withstoode" auto="true">withstood</normalised> the spirit in <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> to his face, saying that she would not doe it: on this night as she sat at supper with the rest of her sisters, she fell into a very <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> fit, bowing and bending of her body, as if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would have broken her <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>, shaking of her hands, as that she could not hold her knife <normalised orig="steedfast" auto="true">steadfast</normalised> & many times, it would thrust it against her <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised>.  When this fit was ended then the spirit seemed to <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> to her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, as it did at dinner, for she used the same manner of gesture to Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> that <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> <normalised orig="behinde" auto="true">behind</normalised> her as before, and gave rather greater <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> of sorrow then otherwise.  On the <normalised orig="suddaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> she arose from the table, and went to the upper end thereof casting, a marveilous <normalised orig="heavie" auto="true">heavy</normalised>, and discontented to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> tothe <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised>, whereby it was perceived that the child had something in her mind that she could not utter (for her mouth was shut up which did greatly dislike her) then the maid was willed to <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> her how she did, the <normalised orig="childs" auto="true">child's</normalised> mouth was presently opened and she made answer to her worse for you, you young witch turning away her face from her, as if she loathed
to look on her.  This was <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> to the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised> to be called young witch at her hand, so she continued questioning with her, as she was willed, but the child turned away her face, and stopped her <normalised orig="eare" auto="true">ear</normalised> which was next unto her, saying that she could not abide to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> her or see her, then the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised> was willed to <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> her what the matter was the child answered that the spirit saith that she must scratch her, when must you scratch me saith the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised>, presently the childes mouth was shut up that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could make no <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised>.  Then did the child begin to <normalised orig="weepe" auto="true">weep</normalised>, most lamentable to see, yet so mixed with anger towards the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised>, as that often times looking upon her, she should suddenly <normalised orig="turne" auto="true">turn</normalised> away her face from her, with such a yearning voice, her teeth being set <normalised orig="togeather" auto="true">together</normalised> as if the <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> spirit had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> whetting and kindling her <normalised orig="furie" auto="true">fury</normalised> against the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised>: cotinuing thus a quarter of an <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised> the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised> was moved to <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, <normalised orig="whe" auto="true">when</normalised> she should scratch her, the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> answered by <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised>, for she could <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> her, but not <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> holding up her finger at (I) and holding it <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> at (no) so that it easily might be gathered, that she should scratch her presently after supper so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as grace was said, then the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised> asked in what part she should scratch her, she answered by <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised>, that it should be upon her right hand, which was the contrary hand to that, which her sister Elizabeth had scratched a <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> before: then M. Throckmorton the childes father caused M. D. Darington, and some other neighbours in the <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised> to be sent for, to whom when they were come he declared what the child had uttered concerning the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised>: In this time before they were come <normalised orig="togeather" auto="true">together</normalised>, there was <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> an <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised> spent, all which time the child continued marveilous pensive, and <normalised orig="heavie" auto="true">heavy</normalised>, weeping very pitifully, yet often fiercely starting out of the place where she sat, towards the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised>, as if she would have fallen upon her before the time, so one of the children being in her fit gave <normalised orig="thankes" auto="true">thanks</normalised>, which so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as ever it was ended, the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> <normalised orig="sincking" auto="true">sinking</normalised> <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> upon her knees (for <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could not stand) fell upon the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised> with such <normalised orig="feircenesse" auto="true">fierceness</normalised>, & rage as if she would have pulled the flesh of her hand from the bones, yet was she scarcely able to race y skin, <normalised orig="sayinge" auto="true">saying</normalised> to the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised> that the spirit that <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> thereby her <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> her, that Pluck <normalised orig="holdeth" auto="true">holds</normalised> her hart & her hand (meaning the <normalised orig="maides" auto="true">maids</normalised>) and will not suffer the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> to come.  When the child was weary with scratching, she

breathed & said that she must have an other fit at her: Then D. Dorington moved the people to pray ith him, all which time she kneeled, very quietly, but when prayers were ended she presently <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> to <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> upon the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised> as before, saying these words to her, with <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised> trickling <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> her cheeks, I would not scratch you, but the spirit <normalised orig="compelleth" auto="true">compels</normalised> me, saying that I must scratch you, as well as my other sisters have done, & as my sister <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> also must doe before the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised>, for this was (if the time be marked) almost three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> before the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised>.

The maid at the first scratching, seemed to go some thing from her, but the child followed still upon her knees, saying to her that she were as good to take it now, as at an other time, for she must fetch <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> on her, & she must have her <normalised orig="pennyworthes" auto="true">pennyworth</normalised> of her, saying farther, y she knew, that she did now cry, (which indeed she did) but she could not <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> her (for so much the spirit <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> her before) because she should not <normalised orig="pittie" auto="true">pity</normalised> her, when the child was weary and <normalised orig="windlesse" auto="true">windless</normalised> she left scratching, & wiped little <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> and water <normalised orig="togeather" auto="true">together</normalised>, which came from the <normalised orig="maides" auto="true">maids</normalised> hand upon her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> hands: Then D. Dorington began to <normalised orig="instructe" auto="true">instruct</normalised> the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised>, and to exhort her with many good <normalised orig="speaches" auto="true">speeches</normalised>, saying that God would surely not suffer her to be thus <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> out upon by these wicked <normalised orig="spirites" auto="true">spirits</normalised>, and afflicted in this <normalised orig="sorte" auto="true">sort</normalised> by these innocent children contrary to their <normalised orig="willes" auto="true">wills</normalised>, if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> were not consenting, or at the least concealing, and of some knowledge of these wicked practices, which her mother had confessed.  The <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised> very <normalised orig="stifly" auto="true">stiffly</normalised> denied all that could be said, & desired God to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> some present token upon her, that they all might know that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was <normalised orig="giltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> of <normalised orig="thse" auto="true">thee</normalised> matters: Presently after these words, her nose began to <normalised orig="bleede" auto="true">bleed</normalised>, and she bled <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> much, which thing whether it were a <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of Gods sending at that time, in token of her giltinesse or not, that he <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>: and man (I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised>) may without offence greatly <normalised orig="suspecte" auto="true">suspect</normalised>.  Yet this <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could say being charged with all, that she had bled <normalised orig="fower" auto="true">four</normalised> times that day before, which thing was very true, bleeding very much every time, <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> saying that she had not bled so much to her remembrance in <normalised orig="seaven" auto="true">seven</normalised> <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> before, wishing that this often bleeding would foreshew no <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> towards her: In thend the child said, of her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, that the thing which now <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> by her

doth tell her, that she must not come <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> of her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> the old man Iohn <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> the <normalised orig="maydes" auto="true">maids</normalised> father, shall come and pronounce <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> words to her which she must tell him: then was she asked by the maid & others that stood by, what those <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> <normalised orig="shold" auto="true">should</normalised> be, but the child could not <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> any body: by & by she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> of her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, what is her father come into this reckoning now? & <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> I never come <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> of my fit, until he <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> these words, even as he is a witch & consented to the death of the La. Crumwell, so to charge the spirit to depart fro me, & then I <normalised orig="shalbe" auto="true">shall be</normalised> well & not before?  I did <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> even so, said she, that he was as bad as the worst, he looked so ilfavouredly: then M. Throckmorto hearing those words of his daughter, desired M. Henry Pickering the childes uncle, & two other of the <normalised orig="neighbors" auto="true">neighbours</normalised>, to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> see if they could procure him to come, but he refused to come, so the company for that night departed, & the child went to bed in her fit, & so continued <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised> day, as hereafter you shall <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>, her father yet not ceasing to send for the man every day, and to go to him <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, yet could by no means procure him to come to his house.  On Sunday following, which was the xviij. of March in the morning, the spirit came <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> unto her, then said the chld, the thing saith that I should now both <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> & see y young witch if she were here (for so y spirits <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> called her) & see the thing also which I never did before, all of the together, then was the maid called for, & asked the child what the thing saith unto her, she answered that the thing <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> her, that now she must start as <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> as her sister <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> both <normalised orig="whensoever" auto="true">whenever</normalised> she <normalised orig="nameth" auto="true">names</normalised> God that she must not come <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> of her <normalised orig="fite" auto="true">fit</normalised>, this <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> nor the next, and peradventure never, until one of these three things come to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised>, which are, either your father (speaking unto y maid) must come & speak these words to me, cue as he is a witch, & hath consented to the death of the La. Crumwell: or you must <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> that you are a witch, & have bewitched me & my sisters: or el you must be hanged: then the maid was willed to <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> the child whether she should come forth of her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, <normalised orig="whensoever" auto="true">whenever</normalised> or <normalised orig="whersoever" auto="true">wheresoever</normalised> her father did <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> these words to her: then the child asked the spirit, and the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> answered, that she should and so for that time  the thing departed & she continued in her fit, the <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> <normalised orig="wherof" auto="true">whereof</normalised> was as <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>, she would <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised> sometimes in the house all the day


together, as one in a <normalised orig="melancholike" auto="true">melancholic</normalised> passion, not speaking to any body, nor desirous of any copany, sometimes <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> she is very lightsome & merry, and will sport & play with her sisters a great part of the day, yet not hearing nor seeing any body, neither speaking to any <normalised orig="particulerly" auto="true">particularly</normalised>, when any <normalised orig="passeth" auto="true">passes</normalised> by her, she will say yonder <normalised orig="goeth" auto="true">goes</normalised> such a coloured gown, I <normalised orig="mervaile" auto="true">marvel</normalised> how it <normalised orig="goeth" auto="true">goes</normalised> alone: yonder is a <normalised orig="paire" auto="true">pair</normalised> of nether stocks of such a colour, or yonder is a hat, a <normalised orig="paire" auto="true">pair</normalised> of shoes or a <normalised orig="cloke" auto="true">cloak</normalised>, but I can see nothing <normalised orig="els" auto="true">else</normalised>.  If one had <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> her their hand with a ring on their finger, she would say yonder is a ring <normalised orig="hangeth" auto="true">hangs</normalised> in the <normalised orig="aire" auto="true">air</normalised>, I <normalised orig="marvaile" auto="true">marvel</normalised> how it <normalised orig="hangeth" auto="true">hangs</normalised> and no body hold it: many will <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> these matters incredible, but assuredly they are most true.  This thing also was many times <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> while those kind of fits continued upon her, that sitting at dinner or supp, she <normalised orig="shold" auto="true">should</normalised> suddenly have her mouth shut, and if Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> had then come, & held a knife to her mouth, & put it betwixt her lips, her mouth should have bin presently opened, & not before, & thus the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised> hath <normalised orig="delt" auto="true">dealt</normalised> with her 5. or 6. times in a dinner while, & in this <normalised orig="fitt" auto="true">fit</normalised> she continued three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> wanting one day, for so long it <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her before thassises.

To come <normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised> now to the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised> day last past on wednesday the 4. of April, Mrs. Joan went to Huntingto, & as she wet upon the way was very well, as she was also all the morning & so continued <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> within <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> after <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had taken her chamber in the <normalised orig="Inne" auto="true">Inn</normalised>: & then suddently as she sate by the fire she <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> into her fit, & having continued so a <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> space, there came divers up into the <normalised orig="chaber" auto="true">chamber</normalised> to see her, who perceiving that she sate so quietly, would not be <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> of any thing to be a <normalised orig="misse" auto="true">miss</normalised> in her: many of them <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her by the hand, & spake to her as they thought good, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> neither heard not perceived any thing at all: The some of the copany turned the to the <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised> Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, who stood by her & came that morning with Mr. <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> fro Warboys, & enquiring of her concerning her faith & service of God, she answered that she served God as other people did, <normalised orig="whe" auto="true">when</normalised> she named God Mrs. <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> began to start and struggle with her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, as if all had not <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised>, which the copany perceiving, brought her <normalised orig="somthing" auto="true">something</normalised> <normalised orig="neerer" auto="true">nearer</normalised>, & willed her to say y Lords <normalised orig="praier" auto="true">prayer</normalised> and her <normalised orig="beliefe" auto="true">belief</normalised>, which the maid began to do, but before she went <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> through, the company desired her for <normalised orig="copassion" auto="true">compassion</normalised> sake to stay
her prayers: for the Gentlewoman Mrs. Joan was so <normalised orig="grieuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> tormented in her body as that it set them all in a maze that saw it, and were resolved of that whereof before they stood <normalised orig="doubtfull" auto="true">doubtful</normalised>, namely that <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> was not in perfect estate: So the company continued their speech to the <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised>, & ever as by occasion she named God or Jesus Christ, <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> started and <normalised orig="strugled" auto="true">struggled</normalised> with her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, <normalised orig="sheuering" auto="true">shivering</normalised> & shaking of her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> & sholders in that manner, as that every body perceived easily that it was not possible for any so to doe of themselves, yea and many times when no body noted the name of God to be uttered by the <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised>, yet would <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> put them in mind thereof by her <normalised orig="strugling" auto="true">struggling</normalised>.  And if the <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised> chanced to double the name of God in her mouth, as to say the God of heaven and earth, or Jesus Christ the <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> of God, it would not suffer her to sit upon her <normalised orig="stoole" auto="true">stool</normalised>: But when she desired the God of heaven & earth to <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> her, or Jesus Christ the <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> of God to be merciful to her, why then it would so strangely torment her, as that they that saw it could not tel whether they should more <normalised orig="woonder" auto="true">wonder</normalised> to see the sight, then lament and <normalised orig="pittie" auto="true">pity</normalised> the <normalised orig="Gentlewomans" auto="true">Gentlewoman's</normalised> case, then a Gentleman in the company (well acquainted with those <normalised orig="maners" auto="true">manners</normalised>) willed the <normalised orig="mayd" auto="true">maid</normalised> to say to <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised>, my God <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> you, or my God preserve & deliver you, or the God who I serve defend you and be merciful unto you, which she did, but <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> never once <normalised orig="mooved" auto="true">moved</normalised> <normalised orig="therat" auto="true">thereat</normalised>, but when she was willed <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to say Jesus Christ <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> you, or the God of heaven & earth <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> you, then would she so struggle & <normalised orig="grone" auto="true">groan</normalised>, as that al the chamber sounded <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>.  And this was <normalised orig="prooved" auto="true">proved</normalised> an hundred times that day, before five hundred men at <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> times, and in the same evening after the Court was broken up, M. Justice Fenner who for that time was Judge alone, had a desire to see <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> Throckmorton, then being at the <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of the <normalised orig="crowne" auto="true">crown</normalised> in the Hunt. being the place where the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> with a great assembly of <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> & <normalised orig="gentleme" auto="true">gentlemen</normalised> met the said Mistr. <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> Throck. in a <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> Alley, being at that present out of her fit, & perfectly well, & after some speeches made by the said <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> to <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised>, she <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> into one of her <normalised orig="ordinarie" auto="true">ordinary</normalised> fits, her eyes closed up, shaking her shoulders & her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> stretched out right, ready to fall to the ground, but that she was assisted by her father, & not being able to stand, she was led into an arbor, whether also went both the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised>, & the other company, there they saw the said Mrs. <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> <normalised orig="grieuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> <normalised orig="tormeted" auto="true">tormented</normalised> most <normalised orig="pittiful" auto="true">pitiful</normalised> to behold, many good prayers were made both by the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> & all the copany, but no case appeared: the the father of the said Mr. <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> told the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> that there was one in the company (naming Agnes Sam.) that if she would say certain words in the <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of a charge, y then the said mistr. <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> <normalised orig="shalbe" auto="true">shall be</normalised> presently well, a thing desired of all the company, <normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised> the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> caused the said Agnes Sam. to stand forward, and to know the charge, which was repeated by M.

Crumwell, so I charge the devil to let mistr. <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> Throck. come out of her fit at this present.  But before Agnes Sam. spoke the charge to make some <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> in others of the effect thereof, the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> himself, D. Dorington, M. Throckm & others spake the words of the charge, but the said <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> had <normalised orig="finall" auto="true">final</normalised> ease by their speeches, neither would she come out of her fit, the both the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> & the other copany made many good prayers & petitions to God, but no amendment appeared, after this Agnes Sam. was <normalised orig="comanded" auto="true">commanded</normalised> by the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> to make some good <normalised orig="praiers" auto="true">prayers</normalised> to God for the ease of the <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> mistr. <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised>, which she did, at which time if the said Agnes Sam. had prayed to God or Jesus Christ, then the said <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> was in <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> more troubled then before, & the reason was foretold by the said <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised>, & all her other sisters by the <normalised orig="spirite" auto="true">spirit</normalised>, that <normalised orig="whensoever" auto="true">whenever</normalised> the said Agnes did use the name of God or Jesus Christ, they <normalised orig="shold" auto="true">should</normalised> be worse troubled then <normalised orig="whe" auto="true">when</normalised> any other spake y words, for he that is perfect God <normalised orig="almightie" auto="true">almighty</normalised> will not suffer his name to be used in the mouth of such a wicked creatures, which was then <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> true, then Agnes Sam. was <normalised orig="comanded" auto="true">commanded</normalised> to say as I am no witch, neither did <normalised orig="cosent" auto="true">consent</normalised> to the death of the La. Cruwell, so I charge the devil to let mrs. <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> come out of her fit at this present, but all this was to no purpose: lastly the <normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised> Agnes Sam. was commanded to say the right charge, which was as I am a witch, & a worse witch then my mother, and did consent to the death of the La. Crumwell, so I

charge the <normalised orig="deuil" auto="true">devil</normalised> to let <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> Throckmorton come out of her fit at this present.  These <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> were no sooner spoken by the said Agnes Samuel, but the said <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> Thorkmorton <normalised orig="wyped" auto="true">wiped</normalised> her <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> and came out of her fit, & made low renerence to the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised>, and so <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> remained about <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> a quarter of an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised>, and then <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> fell into an other <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of <normalised orig="fitt" auto="true">fit</normalised>, first shaking one <normalised orig="legg" auto="true">leg</normalised> & after the other, then one <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised> & after the other, & then her head & shoulders, with other <normalised orig="extraordinarie" auto="true">extraordinary</normalised> passions, to the great <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> of them that were present: but the Judge greatly lamenting the case.  When both he and many others ha dmade some good prayers (and finding no ease) caused the said Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> to repeat another <normalised orig="charme" auto="true">charm</normalised>, vx. As I am a Witch & would have bewitched to death <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> Throkmorton in her last <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> of her great <normalised orig="sicknes" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, so I charge the <normalised orig="Diuel" auto="true">Devil</normalised> to let <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> come out of her fit at this present: which words being <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> by the said Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, the said <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> was presently well.  Then the Judge asked her where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised>: <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> anuswered, I have <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised>.  I pray God, said the Judge, send you no more such <normalised orig="sleepes" auto="true">sleeps</normalised>.  <normalised orig="Soone" auto="true">Soon</normalised> after, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> fell into one of her other <normalised orig="ordinarie" auto="true">ordinary</normalised> <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, with a most strange & terrible kind of neesing, and other passions, the which was so vehement & <normalised orig="pittifull" auto="true">pitiful</normalised> to be heard, that it <normalised orig="moued" auto="true">moved</normalised> all the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> at one instant, to pray to God to <normalised orig="saue" auto="true">save</normalised> her, fearing that her head would have burst in sunder, or her <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> start out of the same, so that the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> made small delay, but caused the said Agnes Samuel to speak the other <normalised orig="charme" auto="true">charm</normalised>, which was, As I am a Witch, and did bewitch <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Pikering of Ellington, since my mothers confession: so I charge the <normalised orig="Divel" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, to let <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> come out of her fit at this present: which words being spoken, presently the said <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> <normalised orig="Ioan" auto="true">Join</normalised> was well as ever <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was in her life, & so hath continued without any grife or <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> till this day.  The Lord be thanked therefore.

The next day being Thursday in the morning, there were three <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> Inditements made, and <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> to the great Inquest, whereof the one was against <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> father <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, old mother Samull, and Agnes their daughter, for bewitching unto death the <normalised orig="Ladye" auto="true">Lady</normalised> Cromwell, late wife of Sir Henry Cromwell of Finchingbrook in the <normalised orig="countie" auto="true">county</normalised> of Huntington Knight, contrary to Gods <normalised orig="Lawes" auto="true">Laws</normalised> & the statute made in the rb. <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Queenes" auto="true">Queens</normalised> <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="reigne" auto="true">reign</normalised> that now is &c.  The other two Inditements were framed upon the said statute for be-

The Inditements being <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> to the <normalised orig="graund" auto="true">grand</normalised> Jury, the evidence was given them privately, by <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Dorington Doctor of <normalised orig="Divinitie" auto="true">Divinity</normalised>, and Parson of the <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised> of Warboyes <normalised orig="aforesaide" auto="true">aforesaid</normalised>, by Gilbert Pickering of Tichemersh in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Northampton Esquire, by Robert Throckmorton Esquire, father of the the said children, by Robert Throckmorton of Brampton in the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Huntington Esquire, by Iohn Pickering and Henry Pickering gentlemen, & by Thomas Nutt <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> of Art, and <normalised orig="Uicar" auto="true">Vicar</normalised> of Ellington.  The <normalised orig="graund" auto="true">grand</normalised> Jury made no great delay, but found them all <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised>.  And about <normalised orig="eyght" auto="true">eight</normalised> of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised>, the <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> by the forenamed gent. was openly at large <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> in the Court, to the Jury of life and death: & with great patience of the Judge, it was continued <normalised orig="til" auto="true">till</normalised> one of the clock in the after <normalised orig="noone" auto="true">noon</normalised>.  So many of these <normalised orig="proofes" auto="true">proofs</normalised>, preseumptions, circumstances, & reasons <normalised orig="conteyned" auto="true">contained</normalised> in this <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>, was at large <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised>, as that time would <normalised orig="afforde" auto="true">afford</normalised>, which was <normalised orig="fiue" auto="true">five</normalised> <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised>, with out intermission or <normalised orig="interuption" auto="true">interruption</normalised>, until both the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised>, <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised>, and <normalised orig="Iury" auto="true">Jury</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> openly that the cause was most <normalised orig="apparant" auto="true">apparent</normalised>: their consciences were <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> satisfied, that the said Witches were guilty, & had <normalised orig="deserued" auto="true">deserved</normalised> death: and therewithal the gent ceased to give any further evidence.  And this as no small thing is to be <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised>, that <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Iane Throckmorton on Friday the xvi. of March last past being in one of her accustomed <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> that the spirit told her, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> should never come out of her <normalised orig="fitt" auto="true">fit</normalised>, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> old father <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> had <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> these <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>: As I am a <normalised orig="Witche" auto="true">Witch</normalised>, &  consented to the death of the Lady Cromwell, so I charge the <normalised orig="devill" auto="true">devil</normalised>, to suffer <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Iane to come out of her <normalised orig="fitt" auto="true">fit</normalised>.  And this she published <normalised orig="opely" auto="true">openly</normalised> in the hearing of many : <normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised> her father sought <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised>, both by <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> and others, to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> Iohn <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> come to his house to the child, but they could not <normalised orig="prevaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised>: wherefore the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Iane continued in <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="senceles" auto="true">senseless</normalised> <normalised orig="fitts" auto="true">fits</normalised> with many <normalised orig="panges" auto="true">pangs</normalised> and vexations in every <normalised orig="parte" auto="true">part</normalised>, as they are before described, from the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> xvi. of March, <normalised orig="til" auto="true">till</normalised> the fourth of April, which was three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> wanting a day: which day also the said <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Iane was brought to Huntington, and there in her fit, was set in the Court before the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised>, where many questions were <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> of her, but she <normalised orig="aunswered" auto="true">answered</normalised> to none, for the <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised> would not suffer <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> co <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>: her eyes were open, yet such a mist was before them, that she neither <normalised orig="knewe" auto="true">knew</normalised>, neither did see <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised>



father, which was next her, and <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> of <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised> uncles and <normalised orig="frends" auto="true">friends</normalised>.  Then the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> caused <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> to be brought from amongst the other prisoners to the upper barr: <normalised orig="nere" auto="true">ne'er</normalised> unto the place where the <normalised orig="clarks" auto="true">clerks</normalised> sate: where also <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Iane. (And the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> being before <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised>, that if old <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> would <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> the <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> before recited, the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Iane should be <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised>.)  The <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> <normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised> asked him, whether he by any <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> could cause the said Iane to come <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> of her <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, who denied the same.  Then the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, as he was informed, that he the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Samuel had a <normalised orig="charme" auto="true">charm</normalised> made of <normalised orig="certein" auto="true">certain</normalised> words, which if he would <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> them, the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> should be <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised>: therefore the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> <normalised orig="recyted" auto="true">recited</normalised> the <normalised orig="charme" auto="true">charm</normalised>, and willed him to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> the <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>, but he refused the same and <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> not <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> them.  The Judge persuaded him, and <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> him, insomuch that the said Judge, the rather to incorage the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Samuel, spake himself openly the <normalised orig="charme" auto="true">charm</normalised>, so did also master Doctor Dorington, and others then present (by the Judges <normalised orig="apoyntment" auto="true">appointment</normalised>:) yet he refused the same.  Many good and goly prayers were openly made to God both by the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> and others, for the case of the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>: whereat the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> seemed nothing to be <normalised orig="moued" auto="true">moved</normalised>.  Then the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> willed Samuel to pray unto God for the comfort of the <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised>, which he did, but when he named God or Jesus Christ, the childes <normalised orig="heade" auto="true">head</normalised>, shoulders, & <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> were sore shaken, and in <normalised orig="shewe" auto="true">show</normalised> more troubled then before.  Then the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> said, y if he would not <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> the words of the <normalised orig="charme" auto="true">charm</normalised>, the court would hold him <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> of the crimes whereof he was accused: & so at the length, with much ado, the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> (with a <normalised orig="loude" auto="true">loud</normalised> <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised>) said in the hearing of al that were present: As I am a Witch, and did consent to the death of the Lady Cromwell, so I charge the <normalised orig="deuill" auto="true">devil</normalised> to suffer <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Iane to come out of her <normalised orig="fitt" auto="true">fit</normalised> at this present.

Which words, being no sooner spoken by the old Witch, but the said <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Iane, as her accustomed order was, wiped her eyes, and came out of her <normalised orig="fitt" auto="true">fit</normalised>: and then seeing her father, kneeled <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, and asked him blessing, and made <normalised orig="reuerence" auto="true">reverence</normalised> to her uncles that stood <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> her: which before <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> toke no <normalised orig="shewe" auto="true">show</normalised> of knowledge: and wondering said: O Lord, father where am I? For that as it <normalised orig="semed" auto="true">seemed</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> neither saw nor heard before, nor knew how she was brought into such a presence.  Then the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>: you see all, she is now well: but not with the <normalised orig="musike" auto="true">music</normalised> of Dauids <normalised orig="harpe" auto="true">harp</normalised>, alluding to the place of Scripture, where King <normalised orig="Saule" auto="true">Sale</normalised> being vexed by an evell spirit received comfort and <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> when David



played on his <normalised orig="harpe" auto="true">harp</normalised> before him.  Then the confession of old mother Samuel (before specified) made the 26. day of December 1592 last past at Burkden, before the <normalised orig="reuerent" auto="true">reverent</normalised> father in God William Bishop of <normalised orig="Lincolne" auto="true">Lincoln</normalised>, was openly <normalised orig="redd" auto="true">red</normalised>: So also was read  the confession of the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> made at Burkden <normalised orig="afore" auto="true">before</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> the 29 day of December 1592 before the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="reuerent" auto="true">reverent</normalised> father in God. William Bishop of <normalised orig="Lincolne" auto="true">Lincoln</normalised>, <normalised orig="Fraunces" auto="true">France</normalised> <normalised orig="Cromwel" auto="true">Cromwell</normalised>, & Richard Tryce Esquires, <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of her <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> peace within the <normalised orig="countie" auto="true">county</normalised> of Huntington, which also is before specified.  After these confessions <normalised orig="redd" auto="true">red</normalised>, and <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> to the Jury, is pleased God for the further <normalised orig="proofe" auto="true">proof</normalised> & <normalised orig="ouerthrowe" auto="true">overthrow</normalised> of these wicked persons to <normalised orig="reare" auto="true">rear</normalised> up <normalised orig="moe" auto="true">more</normalised> witnesses at that time unexpected, who spake <normalised orig="som" auto="true">some</normalised> things of their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> knowledge, and some of the <normalised orig="reporte" auto="true">report</normalised>: the first was Robert Poulter vicar & <normalised orig="Curat" auto="true">Curate</normalised> of Brampton aforesaid, who said openly that one of his parishioners called Iohn Langley, at that instant being very <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> in his bed, had <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> him, that one day he being at Huntington at the <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of the <normalised orig="crowne" auto="true">crown</normalised>, did in the hearing of old mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> forbid Mister Knowles of Brampton aforesaid, to give her any <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised>, for that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was an old <normalised orig="Witche" auto="true">Witch</normalised>: and thereupon in the afternoon, as he went from Huntington to Brampton, having a good horse under him, he presently died in the feilde: and within too <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> after, by the providence of God, he did escape death, twice or thrice very <normalised orig="daungerously" auto="true">dangerously</normalised>: and though it pleased God, not to suffer the <normalised orig="devill" auto="true">devil</normalised> to have the maistry of his body at that time, yet presently after, he lost as many good and sound <normalised orig="Cattell" auto="true">Cattle</normalised> to all <normalised orig="mennes" auto="true">men</normalised> <normalised orig="iudgements" auto="true">judgements</normalised>, as were worth <normalised orig="twentie" auto="true">twenty</normalised> <normalised orig="markes" auto="true">marks</normalised>: <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, not long after, in <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> extraordinarily handled.  And the same night of the day of <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised>, as after it <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> true, the same Iohn Langley died.  Also the forenamed Master Robert Throckmorton of Brampton, (which before had given some evidence against the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> Witches in the childrens <normalised orig="behalfe" auto="true">behalf</normalised>,) now he spake for him <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, that he likewise at Huntington and in other places having dealt <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> roughly in speeches with the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>: On <normalised orig="Fryday" auto="true">Friday</normalised> the tenth day following, had one of his two <normalised orig="yeere" auto="true">year</normalised> <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> <normalised orig="beastes" auto="true">beasts</normalised> dyed: and on Sunday next after another beast of the same <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> and like age died also.  The next <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> after on <normalised orig="Fryday" auto="true">Friday</normalised>, he had a yereling Calfe died, and the next Sunday following, he had an other calfe of the same company & like age died also.  The next <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> after, <normalised orig="Fryday" auto="true">Friday</normalised> he had an <normalised orig="Hogg" auto="true">Hog</normalised> died, and the next Sunday after, he



had a Sow having <normalised orig="tenne" auto="true">ten</normalised> <normalised orig="Pigges" auto="true">Pigs</normalised> sucking on her died also.  Whereupon advice was <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> him, that whatsoever thing next died, to make a hole in the ground, and <normalised orig="burne" auto="true">burn</normalised> the same.  Likewise the fourth <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> on <normalised orig="Fryday" auto="true">Friday</normalised> he had a <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> <normalised orig="Cowe" auto="true">Cow</normalised> worth <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> <normalised orig="markes" auto="true">marks</normalised> died, & his servants made a hole in the ground and buried the same <normalised orig="Cowe" auto="true">Cow</normalised> in it, & threw faggots and fire on her, & burnt her: and after that, all his <normalised orig="cattell" auto="true">cattle</normalised> did well.  Of this last matter, mother Samuel being examined the night before her execution, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> confessed the bewitching of the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="Cattel" auto="true">Cattle</normalised>, in manner and for me as is declared.

Then the <normalised orig="Jaylor" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> of Huntington gave this evidence, That a man of his finding mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> unruly <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> she was prisoner, at a time <normalised orig="chayned" auto="true">chained</normalised> her to a bed-post: wherefore, not long after, his man fell <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised>, and in all <normalised orig="respectes" auto="true">respects</normalised> was handled as the forenamed children were, with heaving up & down of his <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>, shaking his <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, <normalised orig="leggs" auto="true">legs</normalised>, & head, having more strength in him in his <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, than any two men had, crying out of mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, saying that she did bewitch him: and thus remaining in this extradordingary course of <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, about five or <normalised orig="sixe" auto="true">six</normalised> <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> after died.

The said <normalised orig="Jaylor" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> also, that <normalised orig="nat" auto="true">not</normalised> long after the death of his <normalised orig="servaunt" auto="true">servant</normalised>, he had one of his <normalised orig="sonnes" auto="true">sons</normalised> fell <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised>, and was for the most <normalised orig="parte" auto="true">part</normalised> handled as his <normalised orig="servaunt" auto="true">servant</normalised> before named was: so that it was most apparaut that he was bewitched:  therefore the <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="Jaylor" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> went into the Prison, and brought mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> to his <normalised orig="sonnes" auto="true">sons</normalised> bed-side, and there <normalised orig="helde" auto="true">held</normalised> her, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> his <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> had <normalised orig="scatched" auto="true">scotched</normalised> her, and so presently his <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> amended.  And to <normalised orig="drawe" auto="true">draw</normalised> to some <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised>, the Jury of life and death, in the <normalised orig="afternoone" auto="true">afternoon</normalised>, found all the Inditements <normalised orig="Billa" auto="true">Bill</normalised> vera, which when <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> father <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> heard, he <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> to his wife in the hearing of <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised>: A plague of God light upon thee: for thou art <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> that hath brought us all to this, and wee may <normalised orig="thanke" auto="true">thank</normalised> thee for it.

Then the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> <normalised orig="grewe" auto="true">grew</normalised> to sentence, and asked <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> father <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> what <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had to <normalised orig="saye" auto="true">say</normalised> for him <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, why <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> of death <normalised orig="shoulde" auto="true">should</normalised> not be pronounced on him: Whereat he <normalised orig="aunswered" auto="true">answered</normalised>, that he had nothing to <normalised orig="saye" auto="true">say</normalised>, but <normalised orig="Lorde" auto="true">Lord</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="mercie" auto="true">mercy</normalised> on him.  Then the Judge asked <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> what <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had to <normalised orig="saye" auto="true">say</normalised> for her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, to staye Judgement: Whereat <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="aunswered" auto="true">answered</normalised>, that she was with child: which set all the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> on a great laughing, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> more than any other, because as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> thought, there should (for that cause) no
<normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised>.  Her age was <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> fourscore, therefore the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> <normalised orig="moued" auto="true">moved</normalised> her to <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> that <normalised orig="aunswere" auto="true">answer</normalised>: but in no case <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would be driven from it, till at length, a Jury of women were impanelled, and <normalised orig="sworne" auto="true">sworn</normalised> to search her: who <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> up their <normalised orig="verdit" auto="true">verdict</normalised>, that she was not with <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> (as some <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>) it was with the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, & no <normalised orig="marueile" auto="true">marvel</normalised>: for after <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was found <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised>, there went the forenamed <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Henrie Pickering unto her where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> <normalised orig="amongest" auto="true">amongst</normalised> the prisoners, to persuade her to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> the <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised>, and amongst other things <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> confessed, that the forenamed William Langley, who gave unto her the <normalised orig="Spirites" auto="true">Spirits</normalised>, had <normalised orig="carnall" auto="true">carnal</normalised> knowledge of her <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>, when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="receiued" auto="true">received</normalised> them.  Some are of opinion, that it was the <normalised orig="Diuel" auto="true">Devil</normalised> in mans <normalised orig="likenesse" auto="true">likeness</normalised>.

After all this, the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> asked Agnes <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> the daughter, what <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had to say, why <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> of Death should not be <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> her.  At which time, there was one (being a prisoner) standing by her, that willed her to say that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was also with <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>.  Nay, <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised>, that will I not do: It shall <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> be said, that I was both a Witch and a <normalised orig="whoore" auto="true">whore</normalised>.  And so the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> after <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> sound and divine <normalised orig="councel" auto="true">council</normalised> <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> severally to them all, proceeded to <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised>, which was unto death.  The next day, <normalised orig="certeine" auto="true">certain</normalised> godly men went to the prison to <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> the condemned parties to repentance, and to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> their <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised> to the world, and crave pardon at Gods <normalised orig="mercifull" auto="true">merciful</normalised> hands: at which time, mother <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> being asked, by <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Iohn Dorington Esquire, one of her Maisties <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Countrie" auto="true">Country</normalised> of Huntington, whether <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did not bewitch the Lady Cromwell?  <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> said no forsooth, I did not.  Then her husband old father <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised> standing behind, and hearing ber <normalised orig="denie" auto="true">deny</normalised> the same, <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, <normalised orig="denie" auto="true">deny</normalised> it not, but <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> the <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised>: for thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> it one way or other.

The confession of the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> woman Alice Samuel, <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> <normalised orig="certeine" auto="true">certain</normalised> questions that were <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> of her, by master Doctor <normalised orig="Chamberlin" auto="true">Chamberlain</normalised>, at the time and place of her execution being <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the ladder.

And for that her husband would not <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> any thing of the witchcraft at the time of his death, nor of the <normalised orig="priuitie" auto="true">privity</normalised> of <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> or his daughter, as <normalised orig="accessaries" auto="true">accessories</normalised> to the same: It was <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> of her, whether her husband was <normalised orig="privie" auto="true">privy</normalised> to the death of the Lady Cromwell or not: <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> <normalised orig="aunswered" auto="true">answered</normalised>, he was.

And for her daughter, her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> confessed nothing at all touching the witchcraft, but being willed by Master doctor <normalised orig="Chamberlin" auto="true">Chamberlain</normalised> to say the <normalised orig="Lordes" auto="true">Lords</normalised> prayer and the <normalised orig="Creede" auto="true">Creed</normalised> when as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> upon the ladder <normalised orig="readie" auto="true">ready</normalised> to be executed, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> said The Lords prayer, until <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came to <normalised orig="saye" auto="true">say</normalised>, But <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> vs from <normalised orig="euill" auto="true">evil</normalised>, the which by no <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could pronounce: and in the <normalised orig="Creede" auto="true">Creed</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> missed <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> much, and could not say, that she <normalised orig="beleeued" auto="true">believed</normalised> in the <normalised orig="Catholike" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church.


After the execution was ended, and that these three persons were <normalised orig="throughly" auto="true">thoroughly</normalised> dead, the <normalised orig="Jaylor" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> (whose office it is to see them buried) stripped off their clothes, and being naked, he found upon the <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> of the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> woman Alice <normalised orig="Samuell" auto="true">Samuel</normalised>, a little <normalised orig="lumpe" auto="true">lump</normalised> of flesh, in manner sticking out, as if it had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a <normalised orig="teate" auto="true">teat</normalised>, to the length of <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> an inch, which both he and his wife <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised>, at the first sight thereof, meant not to disclose, because it was <normalised orig="adioyning" auto="true">adjoining</normalised> to so secrete a place, which was not decent to be <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised>. Yet in the <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised>, not willing to <normalised orig="conceale" auto="true">conceal</normalised> so strange a mattee, and decently <normalised orig="couering" auto="true">covering</normalised> that <normalised orig="privie" auto="true">privy</normalised> place a <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> <normalised orig="aboue" auto="true">above</normalised> which it <normalised orig="grewe" auto="true">grew</normalised>, they made open <normalised orig="shewe" auto="true">show</normalised> thereof to <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> that <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> by.  After this, the Jayors wife <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> the same <normalised orig="teate" auto="true">teat</normalised> in her hand, and seeming to <normalised orig="straine" auto="true">strain</normalised> it, there issued out at the first, as if it had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> beesenings (to use the <normalised orig="Jaylers" auto="true">Jailers</normalised> word) which is a mixture of yellow <normalised orig="milke" auto="true">milk</normalised> and water. At the second time, there came out, in similitude as <normalised orig="cleere" auto="true">clear</normalised> <normalised orig="Mylke" auto="true">Milk</normalised>, and in the <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised> <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>. For the <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised> of this matter, it is not to be doubted of any: For it is not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> the <normalised orig="Jaylers" auto="true">Jailers</normalised> report unto all that require of him: but there are <normalised orig="fourtie" auto="true">forty</normalised> others also in Huntingtonshire of honest <normalised orig="conuersation" auto="true">conversation</normalised>, that are <normalised orig="readie" auto="true">ready</normalised> to <normalised orig="confirme" auto="true">confirm</normalised> the same upon their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> sight.

And thus ye haus the <normalised orig="storie" auto="true">story</normalised> of these three Witches of Warboyes, so plainly and <normalised orig="briefely" auto="true">briefly</normalised>, as may be <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> unto you. If any be desirous to know the present estate of these children, howe they are & <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> since the death of these parties: you shall understand, that since their day of execution, not any one of them <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> had any fit at all: neither yet grudging or complaining of any such thing, but have all of them <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> in as good estate, and as perfect health as ever-from their birth. Gods blessed name be <normalised orig="euermore" auto="true">evermore</normalised> praised for the same. Amen.
