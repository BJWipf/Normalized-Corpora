They admit of those execrable conditions of commutation of <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised> for the entertaining of the spirits, and so fall to their <normalised orig="abhominable" auto="true">abominable</normalised> practises, continuing in the same till God laugh them to <normalised orig="scorne" auto="true">scorn</normalised>, and will by no <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> suffer them to abuse his holy name nor <normalised orig="deceiue" auto="true">deceive</normalised> others by their <normalised orig="prophane" auto="true">profane</normalised> <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised>

As also a Dialogue concerning Witches and Witchcraft, composed by George Gifford, Minister of Gods word in <normalised orig="Maldon" auto="true">Milton</normalised>, 1603. Wherein the cunning of the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> is <normalised orig="discouered" auto="true">discovered</normalised>, both concerning the <normalised orig="deceiuing" auto="true">deceiving</normalised> of witches, and seducing of others into many great errors: As also an ancient discourse of the <normalised orig="fearefull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> practises of <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> notorious French Witches, with the manner of their strange execution. As also the <normalised orig="seuerall" auto="true">several</normalised> and damnable practises of Mother Sutton of Milton Miles in the County of Bedford, and Mary Sutton her Daughter,

who were arraigned, condemned, and executed for the same: As also 1612. the <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> <normalised orig="discouery" auto="true">discovery</normalised> of Witches in Lancashire, being 19. in number, notorious for many <normalised orig="infamed" auto="true">informed</normalised> actions, and <normalised orig="conuicted" auto="true">convicted</normalised> before Sr. Iames Altham, and S.

And so much for the certainty of Story, and <normalised orig="fearefulnesse" auto="true">fearfulness</normalised> of the truth concerning the damnable practises of Witches and cunning of the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> to <normalised orig="deceiue" auto="true">deceive</normalised> them.

But yet because the mind of man may be carried away with many idle <normalised orig="coniectures" auto="true">conjectures</normalised>, either that <normalised orig="woemen" auto="true">women</normalised> confessed these things by <normalised orig="extreami" auto="true">extreme</normalised>???y of torture, or that ancient examples are by this time forgotten (although the particulars are <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> record, for the benefit of all <normalised orig="posteritie" auto="true">posterity</normalised>:) Or that they were besides <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised>, or <normalised orig="subiect" auto="true">subject</normalised> to some <normalised orig="weake" auto="true">weak</normalised> <normalised orig="deuise" auto="true">devise</normalised> or other, rather to bring in question the integrity of <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised>; then to make odious the <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised> of such horrible <normalised orig="offendors" auto="true">offenders</normalised>. I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> presumed to present on the Stage of verity for the good of my Country & the <normalised orig="loue" auto="true">love</normalised> of truth, the late <normalised orig="wofull" auto="true">woeful</normalised> Tragedy of the destruction of the Right Honourable the <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> of Rutlands Children, who to his <normalised orig="eternall" auto="true">eternal</normalised> praise proceeded yet both religiously and charitably against the offenders, <normalised orig="leauing" auto="true">leaving</normalised> their prosecution to the law and submitting <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, and deplorable case to the <normalised orig="prouidence" auto="true">providence</normalised> of God, who <normalised orig="afflicteth" auto="true">afflicts</normalised> his best <normalised orig="seruants" auto="true">servants</normalised> with punishments, and many times, <normalised orig="sendeth" auto="true">sends</normalised> extraordinary vengeance as well on the innocent, as the bad <normalised orig="deseruer" auto="true">deserver</normalised>, to manifest his glory:

Therefore by way of Caution I <normalised orig="aduise" auto="true">advise</normalised> thee (gentle Reader) <normalised orig="whosoeuer" auto="true">whosoever</normalised> thou art, to take <normalised orig="heede" auto="true">heed</normalised> how thou doest either despise the power of God in his Creatures, or vilipend the <normalised orig="subtilty" auto="true">subtlety</normalised> and fury of the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, as Gods instrument of vengeance, considering that truth in <normalised orig="despight" auto="true">despite</normalised> of <normalised orig="gaine" auto="true">gain</normalised> sayers will <normalised orig="preuaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised>, according to that principle: Magna est veritas & preualebit.

The Story <normalised orig="followes" auto="true">follows</normalised>.
AFter the Right Honourable Sr. Francis Manners succeeded his Brother in the <normalised orig="Earledome" auto="true">Earldom</normalised> of Rutland: and so not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> possession of <normalised orig="Beauer" auto="true">Beaver</normalised> Castle, but of all other his <normalised orig="demeanes" auto="true">demeans</normalised>, Lordships, <normalised orig="Townes" auto="true">Towns</normalised>, <normalised orig="Mannors" auto="true">Manors</normalised>, Lands, and <normalised orig="Reuennues" auto="true">Revenues</normalised> appropriate to the same <normalised orig="Earledome" auto="true">Earldom</normalised>: <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> proceeded so honourably in the course of his life, as neither displacing Tenants, discharging <normalised orig="seruants" auto="true">servants</normalised>, denying the <normalised orig="accesse" auto="true">access</normalised> of the <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised>, welcoming of strangers, and performing all the duties of a noble Lord, that

<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> fastened as it were <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> the <normalised orig="loue" auto="true">love</normalised> and good opinion of the <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised> wherein he walked the more <normalised orig="cheerefully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised> and remarkable, because his honourable <normalised orig="Countesse" auto="true">Countess</normalised> marched <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised> in <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised> with him in the same race; so that <normalised orig="Beauer" auto="true">Beaver</normalised> Castle was a <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> <normalised orig="Pallace" auto="true">Palace</normalised> of entertainment, and a daily receptacle for all sorts both rich and <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised>, especially such <normalised orig="auncient" auto="true">ancient</normalised> people as neighboured the same; amongst whom one <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> Flower, with her Daughters Margaret and Phillp were not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="relieued" auto="true">relieved</normalised> at the first from thence, but quickly entertained as Chair-women, and Margaret admitted as a <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> dweller in the Castle, looking both to the <normalised orig="poultrey" auto="true">poultry</normalised> abroad and the wash-house within <normalised orig="dores" auto="true">doors</normalised>: In which life they continued with <normalised orig="equall" auto="true">equal</normalised> <normalised orig="correspondency" auto="true">correspondence</normalised>, till something was <normalised orig="discouered" auto="true">discovered</normalised> to the noble Lady, which concerned the misdemeanour of these women. And although such honourable persons shall not want of all sorts of people, either to bring the?? <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised>, tales, reports, or to <normalised orig="serue" auto="true">serve</normalised> their <normalised orig="turne" auto="true">turn</normalised> in all offices <normalised orig="whatsoeuer" auto="true">whatsoever</normalised>; so that it may well

bee said of them, as it is of great Kings and Princes, that they <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> large hands, wide <normalised orig="eares" auto="true">ears</normalised>, and piercing sights to <normalised orig="discouer" auto="true">discover</normalised> the vnswept corners of their remotest confines, to reach <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> to their furthest borders, and to <normalised orig="vnderstand" auto="true">understand</normalised> the secrets of their meanest <normalised orig="subiects" auto="true">subjects</normalised>: yet in this matter, neither were they busie-bodies, flatterers, malicious politians, <normalised orig="vnderminers" auto="true">underminers</normalised>, nor supplanters one of <normalised orig="anothers" auto="true">another</normalised> good fortune; but went simply to <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>, as regarding the <normalised orig="honor" auto="true">honour</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> and his Lady, and so by degrees <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> light to their <normalised orig="vnderstanding" auto="true">understanding</normalised> to apprehend their complaints. First, that <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> Flower the Mother was a monstrous malicious woman, full of <normalised orig="oathes" auto="true">oaths</normalised>, curses, and imprecations irreligious, and for any thing they saw by her, a <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> Atheist; besides of late <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> her very countenance was estranged, her eyes were fiery and hollow, her speech fell and <normalised orig="enuious" auto="true">envious</normalised>, her de???eanour strange and <normalised orig="exoticke" auto="true">exotic</normalised>, and her <normalised orig="conuersation" auto="true">conversation</normalised> <normalised orig="sequestred" auto="true">sequestered</normalised>; so that the whole course of her life <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> great <normalised orig="suspition" auto="true">suspicion</normalised> that she was a notorious Witch, yea some of her

neighbours dared to <normalised orig="affirme" auto="true">affirm</normalised> that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> dealt with familiar spirits, and terrified them all with curses and <normalised orig="threatning" auto="true">threatening</normalised> of <normalised orig="reuenge" auto="true">revenge</normalised>, if there were <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> so little cause of displeasure and <normalised orig="vnkindnesse" auto="true">unkindness</normalised>. Concerning Margaret, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> often resorted from the Castle to her Mother, bringing such <normalised orig="prouision" auto="true">provision</normalised> as they thought was <normalised orig="vnbefitting" auto="true">unbefitting</normalised> for a <normalised orig="seruant" auto="true">servant</normalised> to <normalised orig="purloyne" auto="true">purloin</normalised>, and <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> at such <normalised orig="vnseasonable" auto="true">unseasonable</normalised> <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised>, that they could not but <normalised orig="coniecture" auto="true">conjecture</normalised> some <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised> between them, and that their extraordinary <normalised orig="ryot" auto="true">riot</normalised> & <normalised orig="expences" auto="true">expenses</normalised>, tended both to rob the Lady, & to <normalised orig="maintaine" auto="true">maintain</normalised> <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> deboist and base company which frequented this <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> Flowers house the mother, & especially her youngest Daughter. Concerning Phillip, that she was lewdly transported with the <normalised orig="loue" auto="true">love</normalised> of one Th: Simpson, who presumed to say, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had bewitched him: for <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had no power to <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> her, and was as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> supposed <normalised orig="maruellously" auto="true">marvelously</normalised> <normalised orig="altred" auto="true">altered</normalised> both in <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> and body, since her acquainted company: these complaints began many <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> before either their <normalised orig="conuiction" auto="true">conviction</normalised>, or <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised>

apprehension: Notwithstanding such was the honour of this <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> and his Lady; such was the cunning of this monstrous woman in <normalised orig="obseruation" auto="true">observation</normalised> towards them; such was the <normalised orig="subtilty" auto="true">subtlety</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> to bring his purposes to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised>; such was the pleasure of God to make <normalised orig="tryall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of his <normalised orig="seruants" auto="true">servants</normalised>; and such was the effect of a damnable <normalised orig="womans" auto="true">women's</normalised> wit and <normalised orig="malitious" auto="true">malicious</normalised> <normalised orig="enuy" auto="true">envy</normalised>, that all things were carried away in the smooth <normalised orig="Channell" auto="true">Channel</normalised> of liking and good entertainment on <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> side, <normalised orig="vntill" auto="true">until</normalised> the <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> by degrees <normalised orig="conceiued" auto="true">conceived</normalised> some mislike against her; and so, <normalised orig="peraduenture" auto="true">peradventure</normalised> estranged <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> from that <normalised orig="familiaritie" auto="true">familiarity</normalised> and accustomed <normalised orig="conferrences" auto="true">conferences</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was wont to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> with her: <normalised orig="vntill" auto="true">until</normalised> one <normalised orig="Peate" auto="true">Peat</normalised> offered her some wrong; against whom <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> complained, but found that my Lord did not affect her clamours, and malicious information, <normalised orig="vntill" auto="true">until</normalised> one Mr. Vauasor abandoned her company, as either suspicious of her lewd life, or distasted with his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> misliking of such base and <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> Creatures, whom no body <normalised orig="loued" auto="true">loved</normalised> but the <normalised orig="Earles" auto="true">Earls</normalised>

<normalised orig="houshold" auto="true">household</normalised>; <normalised orig="vntill" auto="true">until</normalised> the <normalised orig="Countesse" auto="true">Countess</normalised> misconceiuing of her daughter Margaret, and <normalised orig="discouering" auto="true">discovering</normalised> some vndecencies both in her life and neglect of her <normalised orig="businesse" auto="true">business</normalised>, discharged her from lying any more in the Castle, yet <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> her 40. s. a bolster, & a <normalised orig="mattresse" auto="true">mattress</normalised> of <normalised orig="wooll" auto="true">wool</normalised>: commanding her to go home, <normalised orig="vntil" auto="true">until</normalised> the <normalised orig="slacknesse" auto="true">slackness</normalised> of her <normalised orig="repayring" auto="true">repairing</normalised> to the Castle, as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was wont, did <normalised orig="turne" auto="true">turn</normalised> her <normalised orig="loue" auto="true">love</normalised> and liking toward this honourable <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> and his family into hate and rancor: <normalised orig="wherevpon" auto="true">whereupon</normalised> <normalised orig="despighted" auto="true">despited</normalised> to bee so neglected, and exprobrated by her neighbours for her Daughters casting out of <normalised orig="dores" auto="true">doors</normalised>, and other <normalised orig="conceiued" auto="true">conceived</normalised> displeasures, she grew past all shame and Woman-hood, and many times cursed them all that were the cause of this discontentment, and made her so loathsome to her former familiar friends, and <normalised orig="beneficiall" auto="true">beneficial</normalised> acquaintance.
When the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> <normalised orig="perceiued" auto="true">perceived</normalised> the inficious disposition of this wretch, and that she and her Daughters might easily bee made instruments to enlarge his <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised>, and bee as it were the executioners of his vengeance;

not caring whether it lighted <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> innocents or no, he came more <normalised orig="neerer" auto="true">nearer</normalised> <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> them, and in <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> <normalised orig="tearmes" auto="true">terms</normalised> to come quickly to the purpose, offered them his <normalised orig="seruice" auto="true">service</normalised>, and that in such a manner, as they might easily command what they pleased: For <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would attend you in such <normalised orig="prety" auto="true">pretty</normalised> <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> of dog, cat, or Rat, that they should neither be terrified, nor any body else suspicious of the matter. <normalised orig="Vpon" auto="true">Upon</normalised> this they agree, and (as it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised>) <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> away their <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised> for the <normalised orig="seruice" auto="true">service</normalised> of such spirits, as he had promised them; which filthy conditions were ratified with <normalised orig="abhominable" auto="true">abominable</normalised> kisses, and an odious sacrifice of blood, not <normalised orig="leauing" auto="true">leaving</normalised> out <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> <normalised orig="charmes" auto="true">charms</normalised> and <normalised orig="coniurations" auto="true">conjurations</normalised> with which the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> <normalised orig="deceiued" auto="true">deceived</normalised> them, as though nothing could bee done without ceremony, and a solemnity of orderly ratification. By this time doth <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> triumph, and <normalised orig="goeth" auto="true">goes</normalised> away satisfied to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> caught such fish in the net of his illusions: By this time are these women <normalised orig="Diuels" auto="true">Devils</normalised> incarnate, and grow proud <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> in their cunning and <normalised orig="artificiall" auto="true">artificial</normalised> power, to doe what <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised> they listed By

this time they <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> learnt the manner of inchantations, Spells and <normalised orig="Charmes" auto="true">Charms</normalised>: By this time they kill what Cattle they list, and <normalised orig="vnder" auto="true">under</normalised> the <normalised orig="couert" auto="true">covert</normalised> of flattery and familiar entertainment, <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> hidden the stinging serpent of <normalised orig="mallice" auto="true">malice</normalised>, and a venomous inclination to <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised>: By this time is the <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> and his <normalised orig="familie" auto="true">family</normalised> threatened, and must <normalised orig="feele" auto="true">feel</normalised> the <normalised orig="burthen" auto="true">burden</normalised> of a terrible tempest, which from these <normalised orig="womens" auto="true">women's</normalised> <normalised orig="Diuellish" auto="true">Devilish</normalised> <normalised orig="deuises" auto="true">devises</normalised> fell <normalised orig="vppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> him, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> neither suspecting nor <normalised orig="vnderstanding" auto="true">understanding</normalised> the same: By this time both <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> and his honourable <normalised orig="Countesse" auto="true">Countess</normalised>, are many times <normalised orig="subiect" auto="true">subject</normalised> to <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> and extraordinary conuulsions, which they taking as gentle corrections from the hand of God, submit with <normalised orig="quietnesse" auto="true">quietness</normalised> to his mercy, and study nothing more, then to <normalised orig="glorifie" auto="true">glorify</normalised> their Creator in <normalised orig="heauen" auto="true">heaven</normalised>, and <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised> his crosses on earth.
At last, as <normalised orig="mallice" auto="true">malice</normalised> increased in these damnable Women; so his family felt the smart of their <normalised orig="reuenge" auto="true">revenge</normalised> and inficious disposition. For his eldest <normalised orig="Sonne" auto="true">Son</normalised> Henry Lord

Rosse sickened very strangely, and after a while died: his next named Francis Lord Rosse accordingly, was <normalised orig="seuerely" auto="true">severely</normalised> tormented by them, and most barbarously and inhumanely tortured by a strange <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>; not long after the Lady Katherine was set <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> by their dangerous and <normalised orig="diuellish" auto="true">devilish</normalised> practises, and many times in great danger of life, through <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> maladies and <normalised orig="vnusuall" auto="true">unusual</normalised> fits, nay (as it should <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised>, and they afterwards confessed) both the <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> and his <normalised orig="Countesse" auto="true">Countess</normalised> were brought into their snares as they imagined, and indeed determined to <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> them from <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> any more children. Oh <normalised orig="vnheard" auto="true">unheard</normalised> of <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised> and <normalised orig="mischieuous" auto="true">mischievous</normalised> damnation? Notwithstanding all this did the noble <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> attend his <normalised orig="Maiesty" auto="true">Majesty</normalised>, both at New-market before Christmas, and at Christmas at Whitehall; bearing the <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> of his Children most nobly, and little suspecting that they had miscarried by Witch-craft, or such like <normalised orig="inuentions" auto="true">inventions</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, <normalised orig="vntill" auto="true">until</normalised> it pleased God to <normalised orig="discouer" auto="true">discover</normalised> the <normalised orig="villanous" auto="true">villainous</normalised> practises of these <normalised orig="Woemen" auto="true">Women</normalised>, and to command the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised>

from executing any further vengeance on innocents, but <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> them to their shames, and the <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised> of <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised>, that they might not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> be confounded for their <normalised orig="villanous" auto="true">villainous</normalised> practises, but <normalised orig="remaine" auto="true">remain</normalised> as a notorious example to all ages of his <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> and fury. Thus were they apprehended about Christmas, and carried to <normalised orig="Lincolne" auto="true">Lincoln</normalised> <normalised orig="Iayle" auto="true">Jail</normalised>, after due examination, before sufficient <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of the Peace, and <normalised orig="discreete" auto="true">discreet</normalised> <normalised orig="Maiestrates" auto="true">Magistrates</normalised>, who <normalised orig="wondred" auto="true">wondered</normalised> at their audacious <normalised orig="wickednes" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>, but <normalised orig="Ioane" auto="true">Join</normalised> Flow???r the Mother before <normalised orig="conuiction" auto="true">conviction</normalised>, (as they say) called for Bread and Butter, and wished it might <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> through her if she were guilty of that <normalised orig="wherevpon" auto="true">whereupon</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was examined; so mumbling it in her mouth, <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> spake more <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> after, but fell <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> and dyed as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was <normalised orig="carryed" auto="true">carried</normalised> to <normalised orig="Lincolne" auto="true">Lincoln</normalised> <normalised orig="Goale" auto="true">Goal</normalised>, with a horrible excruciation of <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> and body, and was buried at <normalised orig="Ancaster" auto="true">Ancestor</normalised>.
When the <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> heard of their apprehension, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> hasted <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> with his brother Sr. George, and <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> examining them <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, and sometimes sending them to others;

at last left them to the <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of Law, before the <normalised orig="Iudges" auto="true">Judges</normalised> of assise at <normalised orig="Lincolne" auto="true">Lincoln</normalised>; and so they were <normalised orig="conuicted" auto="true">convicted</normalised> of <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised> and executed accordingly, about the 11. of March, to the terror of all the beholders, and example of such dissolute and <normalised orig="abhominable" auto="true">abominable</normalised> Creatures, and because you shall <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> both cause to <normalised orig="glorifie" auto="true">glorify</normalised> God for this <normalised orig="discouery" auto="true">discovery</normalised>, and occasion to apprehend the <normalised orig="strangenesse" auto="true">strangeness</normalised> of their <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised>, and truth of their proceedings: I thought it both <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> and <normalised orig="conuenient" auto="true">convenient</normalised> to lay open their own Examinations and <normalised orig="Euidences" auto="true">Evidences</normalised> against one another, with such <normalised orig="apparrant" auto="true">apparent</normalised> circumstances, as doe not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> the cause of their mislike and distasting against the <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> and his family; but the manner of their proceedings and <normalised orig="reuenges" auto="true">revenges</normalised>, with other particulars belonging to the true and <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> <normalised orig="discouery" auto="true">discovery</normalised> of their <normalised orig="villany" auto="true">villainy</normalised> and Witch-craft.

<normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> further <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, that by her mothers <normalised orig="commandement" auto="true">commandment</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> brought to her a <normalised orig="peece" auto="true">piece</normalised> of a handkercher of the Lady Katherine the <normalised orig="Earles" auto="true">Earls</normalised> daughter, and her mother put it into hot water, & then taking it out, <normalised orig="rubd" auto="true">rubbed</normalised> it on Rutterkin, bidding him <normalised orig="flye" auto="true">fly</normalised>, and go; <normalised orig="wherevpon" auto="true">whereupon</normalised> Rutterkin whined and <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> Mew: whereupon <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> said, that Rutterkin had no power <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> the Lady Katherine to hurt her.


The Examination of Phillip Flower, the 25. of February, 1618. before Francis <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> of Rutland, Francis Lord Willoughby of Ersby, Sr. George Manners, and Sr. William Pelham.
<normalised orig="SHee" auto="true">She</normalised> <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised> and saith, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> hath a Spirit sucking on her in the <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of a white Rat, which <normalised orig="keepeth" auto="true">keeps</normalised> her left breast, and hath so done for three or <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, and concerning the agreement betwixt her Spirit and her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, she <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised> and saith, that when it came first <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> her, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> her <normalised orig="Soule" auto="true">Soul</normalised> to it, and it promised to doe her good, and cause Thomas Simpson to <normalised orig="loue" auto="true">love</normalised> her, if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would suffer it to <normalised orig="sucke" auto="true">suck</normalised> her, which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> agreed <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised>; and so the last time it <normalised orig="suckt" auto="true">sucked</normalised> was on Tuesday at night, the 23. of February.



The Examination of Margaret Flower, at the same time, &c.
<normalised orig="SHee" auto="true">She</normalised> <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, that she hath two familiar Spirits sucking on her, the one white, the other black spotted; the white sucked <normalised orig="vnder" auto="true">under</normalised> her left <normalised orig="brest" auto="true">breast</normalised>, and the <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> spotted within the inward parts of her secrets. When <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> first entertained them she promised them her <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>, and they <normalised orig="couenanted" auto="true">covenanted</normalised> to doe all things which she commanded them??? &c.

<normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> further saith, that about the 30. of <normalised orig="Ianuary" auto="true">January</normalised>, last past, being Saturday, <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> <normalised orig="Diuells" auto="true">Devils</normalised> appeared <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> her in <normalised orig="Lincolne" auto="true">Lincoln</normalised> layle, at <normalised orig="eleauen" auto="true">eleven</normalised> or <normalised orig="twelue" auto="true">twelve</normalised> a <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> at midnight: The one stood at her beds <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised>, with a <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> head like an Ape, and spake <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> her; but what, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> cannot well remember, at which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was very angry because <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> no plainer, or let her <normalised orig="vnderstand" auto="true">understand</normalised> his meaning: the other three were Rutterkin, Little Robin, and Spirit; but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> mistrusted them, nor suspected her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, till then.


There is another Examination of the said Margaret Flower, taken the fourth of February, 1618. tending to this effect.
THat being asked what <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> concerning the bewitching of the <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> of Rutland, his wife, and children, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> saith, that it is


true, that her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, her mother, and sister were all displeased with him, especially with the <normalised orig="Countesse" auto="true">Countess</normalised>, for turning her out of <normalised orig="seruice" auto="true">service</normalised>, <normalised orig="wherevppon" auto="true">whereupon</normalised> some <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> since, her mother commanded her to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> to the Castle, and bring her the right hand <normalised orig="gloue" auto="true">glove</normalised> of the Lord Henry Rosse, the <normalised orig="Earles" auto="true">Earls</normalised> eldest <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised>; which <normalised orig="gloue" auto="true">glove</normalised> she found on the rushes in the <normalised orig="Nurcery" auto="true">Nursery</normalised>, and <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> the same to her Mother, who put it into hot water, <normalised orig="prickt" auto="true">pricked</normalised> it often with her knife, then <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> it out of the water, and <normalised orig="rubd" auto="true">rubbed</normalised> it <normalised orig="vppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Rutterkin, bidding him height and <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>, and doe some hurt to Henry Lord Rosse, <normalised orig="wherevpon" auto="true">whereupon</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> fell <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised>, and shortly after dyed, which her Mother hearing of, said it was well: but after <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had <normalised orig="rubd" auto="true">rubbed</normalised> the <normalised orig="gloue" auto="true">glove</normalised> on the Spirit Rutterkin, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> threw it into the fire and burnt it, &c.
THese Examinations and some others were taken and charily <normalised orig="preserued" auto="true">preserved</normalised> for the <normalised orig="contriuing" auto="true">contriving</normalised> of sufficient <normalised orig="euidences" auto="true">evidences</normalised> against them, and when the <normalised orig="Iudges" auto="true">Judges</normalised> of Assise came <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> to <normalised orig="Lincolne" auto="true">Lincoln</normalised> about the first <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> of March, being Sr. Henry Hobert, Lord <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised> of the Common Pleas, and Sr. Ed: Bromley one of the Barons of the Exchequer, they were presented <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> them, who not only <normalised orig="wondred" auto="true">wondered</normalised> at the <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised> of these persons, but were amazed at their practises and horrible contracts with the <normalised orig="Diuel" auto="true">Devil</normalised> to <normalised orig="damne" auto="true">damn</normalised> their own <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised>: And although the Right <normalised orig="Honorable" auto="true">Honourable</normalised> <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> had sufficient <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> for the <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> of his Children; yet no

doubt it was the greater to consider the manner, and how it pleased God to inflict on him such a fashion of visitation: Besides, as it amazed the hearers to <normalised orig="vnderstand" auto="true">understand</normalised> the particulars, and the circumstances of this <normalised orig="diuellish" auto="true">devilish</normalised> contract, so was it as <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> to see their desperate <normalised orig="impenitency" auto="true">impenitence</normalised>, and horrible distraction, according to the rest of that sort, exclaiming against the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> for deluding them, and now breaking promise with them, when they stood in most need of his <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised>.
Notwithstanding all these aggrauations, such was the <normalised orig="vnparalleld" auto="true">unparalleled</normalised> magnanimity, <normalised orig="wisedome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised>, and patience of this generous Noble-man, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="vrged" auto="true">urged</normalised> nothing against them more then their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> confessions, and so quietly left them to <normalised orig="iudiciall" auto="true">judicial</normalised> <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised>, desiring of God mercy for their <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised>, and of men charity to censure them in their condemnation: but God is not mocked, and so <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> them <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> to <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised>, nor man so reformed, but for the <normalised orig="Earles" auto="true">Earls</normalised> sake, they cursed them to that place which they <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised> long before had bargained for.

What now <normalised orig="remaines" auto="true">remains</normalised> (gentle Reader) but for thee to make <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of so <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> a Story, and remarkable an accident, out of which, to draw to a conclusion, thou <normalised orig="maist" auto="true">may</normalised> collect these particulars. First, that God is the <normalised orig="supreame" auto="true">supreme</normalised> commander of all things, and <normalised orig="permitteth" auto="true">permits</normalised> <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> actions in the World, for the <normalised orig="tryall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of the godly, the punishment of the wicked, and his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> glory: of which man shall <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="attaine" auto="true">attain</normalised> to know the reason or occasion. Secondly, that the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> is the <normalised orig="meere" auto="true">mere</normalised> <normalised orig="seruant" auto="true">servant</normalised> and

agent of God, to prosecute <normalised orig="whatsoeuer" auto="true">whatsoever</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> shall command rather then <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised>; limiting him yet thus <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> in his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> nature, that he can go no further then the bounds within which <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> is hedged. Thirdly, that this God hath punishments, ad correctionem, that is to say, <normalised orig="chasticements" auto="true">chastisements</normalised> of the godly, & ad ruim, Videlicet, <normalised orig="Iudgements" auto="true">Judgements</normalised> against the wicked, wherein yet man must <normalised orig="disclaime" auto="true">disclaim</normalised> any knowledge, and forsake <normalised orig="preiudicate" auto="true">prejudicate</normalised> opinions. For the very <normalised orig="iust" auto="true">just</normalised> shall be tried like gold, and no man exempted from castigation whom God doth <normalised orig="loue" auto="true">love</normalised>. Fourthly, that this <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, though he bee Gods Instrument, yet <normalised orig="worketh" auto="true">works</normalised> altogether by deceit: for as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was a <normalised orig="lyer" auto="true">liar</normalised> from the beginning; so let no man trust him, because he <normalised orig="aymeth" auto="true">aims</normalised> at the confusion of all <normalised orig="Mankinde" auto="true">Mankind</normalised>. Fiftly, that the wicked, (<normalised orig="howeuer" auto="true">however</normalised> they may <normalised orig="thriue" auto="true">thrive</normalised> and prosper for a time) yet in the end are sure to be payed home, either with punishment in this life or in the life to come, or both, as a <normalised orig="finall" auto="true">final</normalised> reward of monstrous impiety. Sixtly, that Man in his frailty must not presume of prosperity; but prepare a <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of stooping <normalised orig="vnder" auto="true">under</normalised> the hand of God, when it <normalised orig="pleaseth" auto="true">pleases</normalised> him to strike or punish vs. <normalised orig="Seauenthly" auto="true">Seventhly</normalised>, that there is no murmuring nor <normalised orig="repining" auto="true">ripening</normalised> against God, but quietly to tolerate his inflictings, <normalised orig="whensoeuer" auto="true">whenever</normalised> they chance, of which this worthy <normalised orig="Earle" auto="true">Earl</normalised> is a memorable example to all men and Ages. Eightly, that the punishments of the wicked are so many warnings to all irregular sinners to amend their <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised>, and <normalised orig="auoid" auto="true">avoid</normalised> the <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> to come, by <normalised orig="penitency" auto="true">penitence</normalised> and <normalised orig="newnesse" auto="true">newness</normalised> of life. Ninthly, that

though man could bee content to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> blasphemies and offences against the Statutes of Princes, yet God will <normalised orig="ouertake" auto="true">overtake</normalised> them in their own walks, and pull them <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> by the <normalised orig="sleeue" auto="true">sleeve</normalised> into a slaughter-house, as here you know the <normalised orig="euidences" auto="true">evidences</normalised> against these people <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> life and power from their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> Confessions. Tenthly, and last of all, that <normalised orig="priuate" auto="true">private</normalised> opinion cannot <normalised orig="preuaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised> against <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> censures: for here you see the learned and religious <normalised orig="Iudges" auto="true">Judges</normalised> <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> out with our <normalised orig="Sauiour" auto="true">Saviour</normalised>, Ex ore tuo. Therefore though it were so, that neither Witch nor <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> could doe these things, yet Let not a Witch <normalised orig="liue" auto="true">live</normalised>, saith God, and Let them dye (saith the Law of England) that <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="conuersation" auto="true">conversation</normalised> with spirits, and presume to blaspheme the name of God with <normalised orig="spels" auto="true">spells</normalised> and incantation. O then you <normalised orig="sonnes" auto="true">sons</normalised> of men, take warning by these examples, and <normalised orig="eyther" auto="true">either</normalised> <normalised orig="diuert" auto="true">divert</normalised> your steps from the broad way of destruction, and inrecouerable <normalised orig="gulph" auto="true">gulf</normalised> of damnation, or with Iosuahs <normalised orig="counsell" auto="true">counsel</normalised> to <normalised orig="Achan" auto="true">Ashen</normalised>, <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> God for the <normalised orig="discouery" auto="true">discovery</normalised> of <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>, and take thy death patiently, as the <normalised orig="preuention" auto="true">prevention</normalised> of thy future <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised>, and <normalised orig="sauing" auto="true">saving</normalised> innocents from punishment, who otherwise may be suspected without a cause.
Vtinam tam facile vera inuenire possem, quam <normalised orig="falsa" auto="true">false</normalised> conuincere.
