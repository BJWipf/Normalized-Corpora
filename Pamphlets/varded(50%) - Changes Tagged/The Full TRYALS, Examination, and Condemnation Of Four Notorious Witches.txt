An Account of the <normalised orig="Tryals" auto="true">Trials</normalised>, and Examination, and Condemnation, of Four Notorious Witches, &c.
SOme Wise Men in all Ages of the World, have been very hardly brought to believe the Account of Extraordinary Relations, especially about Witches and Witch-craft, but it is an open Violence, or at least a manifest injury, to common <normalised orig="Sence" auto="true">Sense</normalised>, to Codemn all Facts, as false because some are so, at this rate all Criminals ought to be Acquitted, because some hve Suffered undeservedly: But that there are, and hath been Witches and Witch-crafts, many Authors have <normalised orig="prov'd" auto="true">proved</normalised> at large from Reasons Scripture, Antiquity, and the Expearance of all Nations and Ages The following Narritive coming to my hand i thought it might be acceptable to the <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised>, Especially since Providence designs those Eminent, <normalised orig="Occurances" auto="true">Occurrences</normalised> <normalised orig="raither" auto="true">raider</normalised> for our Practical instruction than for a Subject of Notional Speculation.

On Saturday March the 5th the Assizes being then at VVorcester, the <normalised orig="Tryals" auto="true">Trials</normalised> of Rebecca West, Margaret Landis, Susan Cock, and Rose Hallybread, Four Notorious and Reputed Witches, came on for several Diabolical and abominable Practises, by Witchcraft and Fascination on the Bodies of Children and Cattle, &c. The Court being Sat, Rebecca West was brought to the Bar, when after her Indictment was Read. Iohn Edes was <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> as an Evidence against her, who Deposed that the said Rekecca West some Weeks a go <normalised orig="Confess'd" auto="true">Confessed</normalised> to him; that she had familiarity with the Devil, who came to her in the likeness of a young Man, promising her that she should be revenged of all her <normalised orig="Enimies" auto="true">Enemies</normalised>, and have what she desired, if she would deny God and <normalised orig="wholy" auto="true">wholly</normalised> trust to him; and that the said Prisoner further told him, that upon requesting

the Devil to revenge her on one Iohn Start who Livd in the same House, he quickly after <normalised orig="Sickned" auto="true">Sickened</normalised> and Dyed, so that she then thought he could do as God, and thereupon desired him to <normalised orig="joyn" auto="true">join</normalised> in that Wicked and <normalised orig="Develish" auto="true">Devilish</normalised> Art, <normalised orig="Mathew" auto="true">Matthew</normalised> Hopkins, also Deposed that the said Prisoner Confessed to him since in Prison, that the Devil came to her one Night as she was going to Bed, and told her he would Mary her, and that he then kissed her, but was as cold as Clay, and that he took her by the Hand and leading her about the Chamber a turn or two, he said they were Married, and promised to be her Loving Husband, and to avenge her of her <normalised orig="Enimies" auto="true">Enemies</normalised>; and that she sent the Devil to Kill the said Iohn Hart, which was done accordingly. Thomas Hart Father of the Deceased Deposed that he verily believed that his Son dyed by Witchcraft, and that during his Torture he heard him cry out against Rebecca West; a <normalised orig="Docter" auto="true">Doctor</normalised> of <normalised orig="Physick" auto="true">Physic</normalised> also spoke to the same Effect, as did several <normalised orig="otheres" auto="true">others</normalised>; Upon which being asked by the Court what she could say for herself, she only <normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised> that her great Povety had <normalised orig="occasion'd" auto="true">occasioned</normalised> all this, and pleaded guilty, desiring Mercy, but the Jury after having received their Charge, <normalised orig="Imediatly" auto="true">Immediately</normalised> brought her in guilty of <normalised orig="Murther" auto="true">Murder</normalised> and Witch-craft.
Then Margaret Landish, was brought to the Bar, and <normalised orig="Arrain'd" auto="true">Arraigned</normalised> for Witch-craft, and Diabolical Sorcery, &c. The first Evidence deposed that about the ••rst of December, as the said prisoner passed by his Door, a Child of his, then pointed at her, saying there goes <normalised orig="pegg" auto="true">pig</normalised> the Witch, upon which the said Margaret <normalised orig="turn'd" auto="true">turned</normalised> back and <normalised orig="Clap'd" auto="true">Clapped</normalised> her Hands in a

<normalised orig="Threatning" auto="true">Threatening</normalised> manner, telling her she should Sma〈…〉 it, and that very Night the said Child fell Sick in Raving manner, and dyed within three Weeks after. Another Witness deposed, that the said Child, when in its Violent <normalised orig="Fitts" auto="true">Fits</normalised>, would often say that <normalised orig="pegg" auto="true">pig</normalised> the Witch was by her Bed side, making strange Mouths at her. Another Evidence deposed, that she once heard the said Margaret say, that she could not enjoy her <normalised orig="Helth" auto="true">Health</normalised>, if she did not send her Imps to do some Mischief or another, and that her Imps did usually suck two Teats near the privy parts; upon which the said Evidence being asked how she got this Confession from the prisoner, she <normalised orig="reply'd" auto="true">replied</normalised> that the said prisoner, did use her Endeavours to <normalised orig="Intice" auto="true">Entice</normalised> her to be a Witch also by telling her that she should want for nothing, and further added that she went with her to a Witches Meeting, where she saw the Devil in the likeness of a tall black Man, at which she was so much <normalised orig="afrighted" auto="true">affrighted</normalised> that she never went with her any more. Another young Woman spoke, partly to the same effect, and that she was once with the said Margaret, and other, in Mr. Bargrrans Orchard, consulting and plotting the <normalised orig="Childs" auto="true">Child's</normalised> Ruin; the <normalised orig="Childs" auto="true">Child's</normalised> <normalised orig="Docter" auto="true">Doctor</normalised> also deposed that she dyed of a Distemper, which was more than <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised> Natural, and that she was under the Torture of some Diabolical Agent: The prisoner in her own defence, said that they were all Malicious people and <normalised orig="deny'd" auto="true">denied</normalised> that she had Confessed any thing to the Evidence, insinuating as if they had formerly an old Grudge against her, and thereupon made a strange Howling in the Court, to the great disturbance of the whole Bench. Upon which the Court having <normalised orig="explain'd" auto="true">explained</normalised>


and <normalised orig="Sum'd" auto="true">Summed</normalised> up the Evidence, told the Jury that as they ought to beware of Condemning the Innoccent, <normalised orig="punc" auto="true">puns</normalised>; if they thought the <normalised orig="Credite" auto="true">Credit</normalised> of the Evidence sufficent in what they had deposed, their Eyes ought not to spare her, adding that the Holy Scripture declares, that we must not suffer a Witch to Live, Especially, when guilty of <normalised orig="Murther" auto="true">Murder</normalised> Tortures, &c. Whereupon the Jury after an Hours Consultation brought her in guilty.
Susan Cock, and Rose Hallybread, was next Arraigned for Sorcery and Witch-craft, in <normalised orig="Torrmenting" auto="true">Tormenting</normalised> and <normalised orig="Murthring" auto="true">Murdering</normalised> of Mary Peak, and Iohn Peak, the Children of Obadiah Peak of Preston; The chief Evidence against them were Abraham Chad, and Elin Shearcraft, who deposed that they were present with the prisoners, when they first attempted to Torment the said Children; they being then going to enter into that devilish way of practise, and being asked how they went about such a damnable Action, they both were jointly declaring the whole matter, but the Court caused them to be Examined, apart and <normalised orig="Seperate" auto="true">Separate</normalised> from one another, to find whither their Evideece agreed: Whereupon Abraham Chad was Examined and the other Evidence had out of the Court; at which time, he the said, Abraham deposed that, in the House of Susan Cock, the two prisoners having made a great Fire, they made the Shape of the dceased Children in Wax, and <normalised orig="puting" auto="true">putting</normalised> them both on a Spit, one of prisoners <normalised orig="turn'd" auto="true">turned</normalised> it, while the other Stuck <normalised orig="pinns" auto="true">pins</normalised> and needles in their Bellies, Heads, and Eyes, and told him that as them Figuers wasted, the Children <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> waste and is the Spit wene round, they both Muttered to themselves
strange kind of words, which he did not understand: He also Deposed that several Imps in the shape of Mice ran to and from the Fire, and that the next day he heard his Neighbours discourse, how the Children weae Tormented, with strange Prickings in their Eyes, Belly and Head, and so continued <normalised orig="worss" auto="true">worse</normalised>, and <normalised orig="worss" auto="true">worse</normalised> till they Dyed, which was about a Week after. Elin Shearcreft being <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> in, gave the very same Account, tho <normalised orig="somthing" auto="true">something</normalised> more large and exact: The Father and Mother of the two Children said, that about the same time that the Evidence <normalised orig="mention'd" auto="true">mentioned</normalised>, they <normalised orig="cry'd" auto="true">cried</normalised> out against the said Witches by Name, and <normalised orig="continualy" auto="true">continually</normalised> made complaints, as if <normalised orig="Pinns" auto="true">Pins</normalised> and Needles had been actually thrust into their Bodies, without <normalised orig="Intermision" auto="true">Intermission</normalised> for above an Hour together. A Midwife and other Women Deposed in Court that searching the Bodies of the Prisoners, they found several large <normalised orig="Teates" auto="true">Teats</normalised> in the secret Parts of their Bodies: and at the same time asking them, how they came there, they both made Answer, that the Devils Imps had done it. However upon their <normalised orig="Tryals" auto="true">Trials</normalised>, they <normalised orig="deny'd" auto="true">denied</normalised> each Particular, <normalised orig="alledging" auto="true">alleging</normalised> that they were not

then in their <normalised orig="Sences" auto="true">Senses</normalised>, and seemed both to weep and howl, tho not one Tear could be <normalised orig="descovered" auto="true">discovered</normalised> to fall from their Eyes; many more <normalised orig="Witneses" auto="true">Witness</normalised> <normalised orig="apeared" auto="true">appeared</normalised> against them, concerning the Bewitching Mr. Peaks Children, which for brevity sake I am forced to omit; but in fine it appearing on all hands that they had been very base and Notorious Persons, for several Years; and none appearing on their Behalfs. The Court <normalised orig="sum'd" auto="true">summed</normalised> up each Circumstance with great care, tenderness, and Moderation, and delivered their Opinions to the Jury, with all the <normalised orig="Leagal" auto="true">Legal</normalised> Fairness, and Justice that could be desired, or expected, even from the Witches themselves, desiring God to direct them in their Verdict. However the matte being proved against the Prisoners by unanswerable Demonstration, and <normalised orig="undenyable" auto="true">undeniable</normalised> Evidence, as well as Extraordinary Circum,stances, the Jury brought them in both guilty of Witch-craft, Fascination and <normalised orig="Murther" auto="true">Murder</normalised>, and received <normalised orig="Sentance" auto="true">Sentence</normalised> to be Burnt at the Stak all Four together.
When being come to the Place of Execution, they made a strange and lamentable


Yeling and Howling, after which they confessed the Crimes, for which they Suffered and also declared how they had <normalised orig="Kill'd" auto="true">Killed</normalised> abundance of Cattle for several years past, and that it was <normalised orig="extream" auto="true">extreme</normalised> Pride, Malice and Revenge that caused them to Enter into such a <normalised orig="curssed" auto="true">cursed</normalised> an Hellish League with the Devil, who told them to the last, that he would secure them from <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> Punishment, but now to late, they found him a <normalised orig="Lyer" auto="true">Liar</normalised>, as he was from the <normalised orig="begining" auto="true">beginning</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Wor" auto="true">Worcester</normalised> Cock and Landish <normalised orig="seem'd" auto="true">seemed</normalised> penitent, desiring all you Women to take Warning by their Devilish Lives, and Shameful Deaths, assuring the Spectators, that as Satan in the first Infancy of the World <normalised orig="prevaild" auto="true">prevailed</normalised> on Woman to bring his Hellish attempts to pass, so still strives with that Sex, as the weaker Vessels Work their Distructions; they both said the Lords prayer very Distnctly, but Rebecca West, and Rose Hallybread dyed very Stuburn, and Refractory without any <normalised orig="remorss" auto="true">remorse</normalised>, or seeming Terror of Conscience for their abominable VVitch-craft.
I heartly wish the sad Fates of these Four Notorious and Barbarous Wretches may be a warning to all Malicious, and <normalised orig="Revengful" auto="true">Revengeful</normalised> persons whatsoever, least the Devil who sets them on Work, at last pays them the Witches with Eternal Damnation, whieh undoubtedly will be the  portion of all those, who wilfully Engages in the Service of so faithless Master.
