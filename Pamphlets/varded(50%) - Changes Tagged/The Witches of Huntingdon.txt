And the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> then <normalised orig="offer'd" auto="true">offered</normalised> her, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would doe what <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised> she should require him; and said she must covenant with him that he must have her <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> at the end of one and twenty years, which she granted. And saith, that he came to her about a week after, about ten of the clock in the night, with a Paper, and asked her whether she were willing to <normalised orig="seale" auto="true">seal</normalised> the Covenant, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> said she was, then he told her it must be done with her <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>, and so pricked her under her left

And being demanded what light was there, she answered, none but the light of the Spirit, and presently he came to bed to her, and had the <normalised orig="carnall" auto="true">carnal</normalised> knowledge of her, and so did divers times after, and saith, the other two Spirits did then, and at other times come into her bed also, and <normalised orig="suckt" auto="true">sucked</normalised> upon other parts of her body where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had Teats. Being demanded the name of the lesser Spirits, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> saith the name of the white one was <normalised orig="Lilly" auto="true">Lily</normalised>, and the <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> one Priscill; and that the office of <normalised orig="Lilly" auto="true">Lily</normalised> was to hurt man, woman, or coilde; and the office of Priscill was to hurt <normalised orig="Cattell" auto="true">Cattle</normalised> when she desired. And the office of the man-like Spirit was to lye with her carnally, when and as often as she desired, and that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> did lye with her in that manner very often; and that the Spirit <normalised orig="Lilly" auto="true">Lily</normalised>, acchrding to the Covenant, did kill the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> of Mr. Henry Bedells of Catworth aforesaid, as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> this Examinate desired him to do; and that she <normalised orig="wisht" auto="true">wished</normalised> him to doe the same when she was <normalised orig="angrie" auto="true">angry</normalised>; but doth not well remember for what: and saith, that about two or three <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> before that, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> sent the same <normalised orig="Lilly" auto="true">Lily</normalised> to the said Henry Bedells commanding him to kill him, who returned and said <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had no power: and <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> sent her said Spirit another time to doe some hurt to Edward Musgrave of Catworth, aforesaid, who likewise returned answer, he had no power: And that she sent her Spirit Priscill to kill two horses of the said Edward Musgraves, and one of John Musgraves, and to <normalised orig="kil" auto="true">kill</normalised> one Co• of William Musgraves, and one Cow of Thomas Th•rps of the same <normalised orig="Towne" auto="true">Town</normalised>, which was done accordingly.

<normalised orig="HEe" auto="true">He</normalised> saith, that about 29. <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> since, the 29th <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> ending about Midsommer last past, he being a <normalised orig="Batchellour" auto="true">Bachelor</normalised>, lived at Thropston with one Buoeman, who then kept the <normalised orig="Inne" auto="true">Inn</normalised> at the George, and <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised> kept Husbandry: this Examinate being a servant to him in his husbandry, did then loose a purse with 7 s. in it, for which he suspected one in the Family. He saith that on a Friday being in the <normalised orig="barne" auto="true">barn</normalised>, making hay-bottles for his horses about noon, swearing, cursing, raging, and wishing to <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> that some wise body (or <normalised orig="Wizzard" auto="true">Wizard</normalised>) would <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> him to his purse and money again: there <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> unto him a Spirit, <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> and shaggy, and having <normalised orig="pawes" auto="true">paws</normalised> like a <normalised orig="Beare" auto="true">Bear</normalised>, but in bulk not fully so big as a Coney. The Spirit asked him what he ailed to be so <normalised orig="sorrowfull" auto="true">sorrowful</normalised>, this Examinate answered that he had lost a purse and money, and knew not how to come by it <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>. The Spirit replied, if you will forsake God and Christ, and fall down & worship me for your God, I will help you to your purse and <normalised orig="mony" auto="true">money</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>: This Examinate said he would, and thereupon fell down upon his knees and held up his hands. Then the Spirit said, to morrow about this time of the day, you shall find your purse upon the floor where you are now making bottles, I will send it to you, and will also come my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>. Whereupon this Examinate told the Spirit he would <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> him there, and receive it, & worship him. Whereupon at the time prefixed, this Examinate went unto the place, and found his purse upon the <normalised orig="floore" auto="true">floor</normalised> and <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> it up, and looking afterwards into it, he found there all the money that was formerly lost: but before he had looked into it, the same Spirit appears unto him and said, there is your purse and your money in it: and then this Examinate fell <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> upon his knees and said, my Lord and God I <normalised orig="thanke" auto="true">thank</normalised> you. The said Spirit at that


time brought with him two other Spirits, for shape, <normalised orig="bignesse" auto="true">bigness</normalised>, & colour, the one like a white Cat, the other like a grey Coney: and while this Examinate was upon his knees, the <normalised orig="Beare" auto="true">Bear</normalised> Spirit spake to him, saying, you must worship these two Spirits as you worship me, and take them for your Gods also: then this Examinate directed his <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> towards them, and <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> them his Lords and Gods. Then the <normalised orig="Beare" auto="true">Bear</normalised> Spirit told him that when he dyed he must have his <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>, whereunto this Examinate yielded. <normalised orig="Hee" auto="true">He</normalised> told him then also that they must suck of his body, to which this Examinate also yielded, but they did not <normalised orig="sucke" auto="true">suck</normalised> at that time. The <normalised orig="Beare" auto="true">Bear</normalised> Spirit promised him that he should never want <normalised orig="victualls" auto="true">victuals</normalised>. The Cat Spirit that it would hurt <normalised orig="cattel" auto="true">cattle</normalised> when he would desire it. And the Coney-like Spirit that it would hurt men when he desired. The bear spirit told him that it must have some of his blood wherewith to <normalised orig="seale" auto="true">seal</normalised> the Covenant, whereunto this Examinate <normalised orig="yeelded" auto="true">yielded</normalised>, and then the <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised> Spirit leapt upon his shoulder, and <normalised orig="prickt" auto="true">pricked</normalised> him on the head, and 〈◊〉 thence <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> blood: and after thus doing, the said three spirits <normalised orig="vanisht" auto="true">vanished</normalised> away. The next day about <normalised orig="noone" auto="true">noon</normalised>, the said Spirits came to him while <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was in the field, and told him they were come to suck of his body, to which he yielded, and they <normalised orig="suckt" auto="true">sucked</normalised> his body at the places where the marks are found, and from that time to this, they have come constantly to him once every 24. hours, sometimes by day, and most commonly by night. And being demanded what <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised> he caused any of the said Spirits to do, he answered never any, <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> sent his <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised> Spirit to provoke the Maid-servant of Mr. Say of Molmesworth to <normalised orig="steale" auto="true">steal</normalised> <normalised orig="victualls" auto="true">victuals</normalised> for him out of her Masters house, which she did, and this Examinate received the same.

April the 8. day, Anno 1646.
ANne Desborough of Bythorn in the County of Huntington, <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, that about 30. <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> since, the first <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> of <normalised orig="Cleane" auto="true">Clean</normalised> Lent, there appeared unto her a thing some-what bigger then a Mouse, of a brown colour, and of the <normalised orig="likenesse" auto="true">likeness</normalised> of a mouse. This was while <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> lived at Tichmarsh in the County of Northampton: she being there in bed, and in a <normalised orig="dreame" auto="true">dream</normalised>, the said <normalised orig="likenesse" auto="true">likeness</normalised> then gave her a nip, and thereby awakened her out of her <normalised orig="dreame" auto="true">dream</normalised>, and then told her (when she was awakened) that it must have part of her <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>; whereupon she was in a great <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised>, and gave him no answer, but prayed to God, and thereupon it vanished away from her. About five <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> after, the same Mouse appeared to her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, bringing with it another Mouse, about the <normalised orig="bignesse" auto="true">bigness</normalised> of an ordinary Mouse, or very little bigger, browne like the former, save only that this latter had some white about the belly, whereas the former was all browne. Then the Mouse that first appeared, said, we must <normalised orig="sucke" auto="true">suck</normalised> of your body. <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> yielded to them, and said, they should: upon her yielding they went to her, and sucked of her <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>, where the <normalised orig="markes" auto="true">marks</normalised> are found. The


bigger mouse she called Tib, and the lesser <normalised orig="Jone" auto="true">Jon</normalised>. Tib told her that she must forsake God and Christ, and take them for her Gods: telling her that when she dyed, they must have her <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>, to all which she yielded. Tib promised her to hurt men if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> should desire. <normalised orig="Jone" auto="true">Jon</normalised> promised her to hurt <normalised orig="Cattell" auto="true">Cattle</normalised> if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> should desire. Within two <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> after they appeared again: and ever after till <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was discovered, they appeared once every 24. <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised>.

The Examination of Jane Wallis of Keiston in the County of Huntington Spinster taken the 16th day of <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised>, 1646. before Sir Robert <normalised orig="Osborn" auto="true">Osborne</normalised> Knight, one of his Majesties Justices of the Peace for the County of Huntington.
THis Examinate saith, as she was making of her <normalised orig="bedde" auto="true">bed</normalised> in her Chamber, there appeared in the shape of a man in <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> <normalised orig="cloaths" auto="true">clothes</normalised> and blackish <normalised orig="cloaths" auto="true">clothes</normalised> about <normalised orig="sixe" auto="true">six</normalised> weeks past, and bid her good-morrow, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> asked what his name was, and he said his name was Blackeman, and asked her if she were <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised>, and she said I; then he told her he would send one Grissell and Greedigut to her, that shall do any thing for her: <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> looking upon him, saw <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had ugly <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised>, and then she was very <normalised orig="fearfull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> of him for that he would seem sometimes to be tall, and sometimes <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised>, and suddenly vanished away.

And being demanded whether he lay with her, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> said <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would have lain with her, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would not suffer him: and after Blackeman was departed from her, within three or 4. <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, Grissell and Greedigut came to her, in the shapes of <normalised orig="dogges" auto="true">dogs</normalised> with great brisles of <normalised orig="hogges" auto="true">hogs</normalised> <normalised orig="haire" auto="true">hair</normalised> upon their backs, and said to her they were come from Blackeman to do what she would command them, and did <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> her if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did want any thing, and they

would fetch her any thing: and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> said <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> lacked nothing: then they prayed her to give them some victuals, and she said she was <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> and had none to give them, and so they departed: Yet the confessed that Blackman, Grissell, and Greedigut divers times cames to her afterwards, and brought her two or three shillings at a time, and more saith not.

April 14. 1646.
<normalised orig="IOANE" auto="true">JOIN</normalised> WALLIS confessed to me, and John Guylet that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had three Spirits, she called them Black-man, Grissel, and Gredigul, and that Blackman gave her the other two, and told her they should doe any thing for her that she should desire: she said Blackman came first to her, about a twelve-moneth since, like a man something ancient, in blackish <normalised orig="cloathes" auto="true">clothes</normalised>, out he had ugly feet uncovered. Sometimes she said it was longer since he first came to her, and ever since he appeared in the like shape, but Grissell, and Greedigut did come in <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> shapes, yet most commonly like hounds with Brissells on their <normalised orig="backes" auto="true">backs</normalised>. I asked her what use she put them to, and if any of them had the use of her body besides sucking; she said he would have had once, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised> him: then presently of her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> said, if I would not tell, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>, but she hoped I would love her never the worse, and then <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> said that Blackman had the use of her body once, twice, and sometimes thrice in a week, but the other two <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> sucked her where her marks are found; she said Blackman never sucked her; she would not <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> that she ever sent them to doe any <normalised orig="harme" auto="true">harm</normalised>, but said the filthy rough Blackman would send them; but what hurt they did she confessed not to us. I asked her to what purpose she set Gris. and Greed. suck her if she made no use of them? she said, they would sometimes bring her money, two or three shillings at a time, and that was all they did

for her; and once they told her they <normalised orig="robb'd" auto="true">robbed</normalised> a man, and pulled him from his horse, and brought her some money.
All this she confessed to me before Dinner, and after Dinner she affirmed it all to be truth, but in the repeating she would seem to forget Gris. and Greed. names, but <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> affirmed the same of Blackman; She said, she first would have had them sucked her breasts, but they would not, and chose the place themselves.

<normalised orig="quartereth" auto="true">quartered</normalised>, and sitting <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> by Stanwick <normalised orig="Townes" auto="true">Towns</normalised> end, saw one <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> from Artlebroward; who when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> came <normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> to this Informant, this Informant said, I have staid for you a long time; but he answered, I saw you not all the way I came. Then this Informant said to him, from whence came you? who answered, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> came from his Uncles at Artlebrow: Then this Informant asked him who was his Uncle? and <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> said one Clarke: this Informant asked him, if <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> were not <normalised orig="Clarks" auto="true">Clerks</normalised> <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> of Keiston, he answered, he was: And then this Informant asked him, What haste he was in? who said he was in haste; for his Father and Mother were accused for Witches, and that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> searched; and this Informant answered, and so have I. Then Clarke asked this Informant, whether any thing were found about him, or not? he (this Informant) answered that they said there were marks: Clarke said <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, had you no more wit but to have your marks found? I cut off mine three <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> before I was searched. And then after some further communication past concerning who searched them, Clark said to this Informant, I doe not <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> you are a Witch, for I never saw you at our meetings: who answered, that perhaps their meetings were at <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> places, and so fell out and parted.
