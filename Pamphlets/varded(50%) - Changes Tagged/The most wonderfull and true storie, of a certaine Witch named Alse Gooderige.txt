A report of the torments and <normalised orig="deliueraunce" auto="true">deliverance</normalised> of Thomas Darling, (a Boy of <normalised orig="thirteene" auto="true">thirteen</normalised> <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> of age) that was possessed by <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised>, at Burton <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Trent.
<normalised orig="VPon" auto="true">Upon</normalised> <normalised orig="Saterday" auto="true">Saturday</normalised> (being the xxvii. of <normalised orig="Februarie" auto="true">February</normalised>) Robert Toone (dwelling in Burton <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Trēt in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Stafford, Uncle to this Thomas Darling) going to Winsell Wood (which is distant from Burton about half a <normalised orig="myle" auto="true">mile</normalised>) to hunt the hare, took the Boy with him; and being carnest in following his <normalised orig="gaine" auto="true">gain</normalised>, lost him: who (after he had a while <normalised orig="wandred" auto="true">wandered</normalised> <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> & <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, and could not <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> his Uncle) returned home to his <normalised orig="vncles" auto="true">uncles</normalised> house, where he <normalised orig="soiourned" auto="true">sojourned</normalised>. Being come home, he <normalised orig="wexed" auto="true">waxed</normalised> <normalised orig="heauie" auto="true">heavy</normalised>, and <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterword</normalised> grew to be <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised>, vomiting & casting <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> what he had eaten at dinner: and so was got to bed. The next morning <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had sore fits, with <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> vomitings, that all which <normalised orig="sawe" auto="true">saw</normalised> him, <normalised orig="iudged" auto="true">judged</normalised> it to bee some strange ague. In the time of this <normalised orig="extremitie" auto="true">extremity</normalised> in these <normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> fits, he would <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> times <normalised orig="poynt" auto="true">point</normalised> with his hand, saying; <normalised orig="Looke" auto="true">Look</normalised> where greene Angels stand in the window, and not long after would often <normalised orig="complaine" auto="true">complain</normalised>, that a green Cat troubled him: which thing was <normalised orig="iudged" auto="true">judged</normalised> by his friends to <normalised orig="proceede" auto="true">proceed</normalised> of <normalised orig="lightnes" auto="true">lightness</normalised> in his head; <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> other things fell out also in these times <normalised orig="worthie" auto="true">worthy</normalised> the noting, whereof (in respect of the <normalised orig="vnexpected" auto="true">unexpected</normalised> <normalised orig="euent" auto="true">event</normalised>) there was no note kept. His sickines

<normalised orig="wexing" auto="true">waxing</normalised> more vehement, his Aunt went to a <normalised orig="Phisition" auto="true">Physician</normalised> with his <normalised orig="vrine" auto="true">urine</normalised>: who said he saw no <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> of <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> natural disease in the Child, <normalised orig="vnles" auto="true">unless</normalised> it were the <normalised orig="wormes" auto="true">worms</normalised>. His <normalised orig="sicknes" auto="true">sickness</normalised> still increasing (notwithstanding <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> thing prescribed or <normalised orig="ministred" auto="true">ministered</normalised>) she went <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> with his <normalised orig="vrine" auto="true">urine</normalised> to the <normalised orig="Phisition" auto="true">Physician</normalised>; who <normalised orig="iudged" auto="true">judged</normalised> as before, saying further, he doubted that the <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> was be witched: which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> (holding incredible) imparted it to no <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>; rather imagining it to bee (though some strange, yet) a <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised> disease: as <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> also <normalised orig="iudged" auto="true">judged</normalised> it to bee the Falling <normalised orig="sicknes" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, by reason that it was no <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> distemperature, but came by fits, with <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> staring, <normalised orig="striuing" auto="true">striving</normalised> and <normalised orig="strugling" auto="true">struggling</normalised> <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> siercely, and falling <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> with sore vomits; also it <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> <normalised orig="awaye" auto="true">away</normalised> the <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of his legs, so that he was <normalised orig="faine" auto="true">fine</normalised> to bee carried <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> and <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, <normalised orig="saue" auto="true">save</normalised> in his fits, for then <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was nimble <normalised orig="inough" auto="true">enough</normalised>. How <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> spent the time <normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised> his fits, it is <normalised orig="woorth" auto="true">worth</normalised> the <normalised orig="obseruing" auto="true">observing</normalised>; his exercises were such as might well <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> beseemed one of riper <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>; wherein he <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> the <normalised orig="frutes" auto="true">fruit</normalised> of his education, which was religious and godly. With those that were good Christians he <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> great pleasure to▪ <normalised orig="conferre" auto="true">confer</normalised>; to whom he would siguiste his daily expectation of death, and his resolute <normalised orig="readinesse" auto="true">readiness</normalised> to <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> the World, and to be with Christ: and all his <normalised orig="loue" auto="true">love</normalised> to the world, he said extended thus <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised>, that (if God had so been pleased) he might <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="liued" auto="true">lived</normalised> to be a preacher to thunder out the threatenings of Gods word, against <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised> and all <normalised orig="abhominations" auto="true">abominations</normalised>, wherewith these <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> doo abound. In these fits and such like speeches, he continued till Mid-lent Sunday, being the xxi. of March. That day (besides that his wonted fit <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> him) he began in other and more strange manner to bee vexed: for <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="sweyed" auto="true">swayed</normalised> downs as one in a <normalised orig="swound" auto="true">swooned</normalised>. <normalised orig="Foorth" auto="true">Forth</normalised> with they <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> him <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised>, and <normalised orig="layd" auto="true">laid</normalised> him <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> a bed: where (<normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> <normalised orig="layne" auto="true">lain</normalised> some <normalised orig="smal" auto="true">small</normalised> space) he arose <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised>, <normalised orig="striuing" auto="true">striving</normalised> and <normalised orig="strugling" auto="true">struggling</normalised> in such sort, that it was enough for two or three to hold him. Then fell <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised>


his <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>, and (lying in such manner) <normalised orig="raysed" auto="true">raised</normalised> <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> his <normalised orig="leggs" auto="true">legs</normalised> one after the other so <normalised orig="stifly" auto="true">stiffly</normalised>, that the standers by could not know them in the <normalised orig="hamme" auto="true">ham</normalised>: and thus continuing a <normalised orig="whyle" auto="true">while</normalised> with <normalised orig="greeuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> roaring, at last he <normalised orig="raysed" auto="true">raised</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> on his <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised> and his head, his belly standing <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> much <normalised orig="aboue" auto="true">above</normalised> <normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> head or <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised>, continuing so a little space he fell <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> <normalised orig="groning" auto="true">groaning</normalised> <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised>. Then rising <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised>, he ran round on his hands and his <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised>, keeping a <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> <normalised orig="compasse" auto="true">compass</normalised>: after that <normalised orig="striuing" auto="true">striving</normalised> and <normalised orig="strugling" auto="true">struggling</normalised> with <normalised orig="groning" auto="true">groaning</normalised>, he <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> a vomiting, and then <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> to <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, the <normalised orig="Lordes" auto="true">Lords</normalised> name bee praised. This was the first fit that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had; and after this <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> was <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> ordinarily handled during the time of his possession (<normalised orig="saue" auto="true">save</normalised> that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> did <normalised orig="seldome" auto="true">seldom</normalised> <normalised orig="runne" auto="true">run</normalised> round in that manner that is aforesaid:) which being thus ended, he fell <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his knees <normalised orig="sodainely" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> to prayer, and that so pithily that the standers by wondered thereat, as much as they did at his strange visitation, <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> comforted by the one, than they were before <normalised orig="greeued" auto="true">grieved</normalised> at the other.
The next day bee <normalised orig="hadde" auto="true">had</normalised> many <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, in the <normalised orig="whith" auto="true">with</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="woulde" auto="true">would</normalised> often point at a greene <normalised orig="Catte" auto="true">Cat</normalised> that troubled him, and still <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> his friends that were preitut to pray for him. <normalised orig="Betweene" auto="true">Between</normalised> his <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> he requested them to <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> the scriptures, which when they could not doe for weeping to behold his <normalised orig="miserie" auto="true">misery</normalised>, they sent (at the <normalised orig="boyes" auto="true">boys</normalised> request) for one Iesse Bee that doth dwell in Burton <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Trent, who <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> the notes of the whole matter, and him the Boy after some speeches <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> to read where he would: who read the xi. Chapter according to Sa. Iohn, till <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> came to the fourth verse, at which time the <normalised orig="Boye" auto="true">Boy</normalised> was <normalised orig="ouerthrowen" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> into a fit like the feintes ī which hes lasted commonly about <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> a quarter of an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised>: Iesse continued reading the xi. xii. and xiii. of Iohns <normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised>, and the first & second of the <normalised orig="Reuelation" auto="true">Revelation</normalised>. During which time, his <normalised orig="fitts" auto="true">fits</normalised> continued one in the <normalised orig="necke" auto="true">neck</normalised> of another.

Which ending with a vomit, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> to <normalised orig="saye" auto="true">say</normalised> The <normalised orig="Lordes" auto="true">Lords</normalised> name bee praised: and <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> times, Lord Iesu <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> my <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>. When Iesse either ceased to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> of <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> comfortable matter, or to read the scriptures, the Boy was quiet from his fits: but when he was so religiously occupied, they came <normalised orig="thicke" auto="true">thick</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> him; which Iesse Bee considering and <normalised orig="obseruing" auto="true">observing</normalised>, told the <normalised orig="Boyes" auto="true">Boys</normalised> Aunt he suspected that the Boy was be witched. Upon which occasion, (though she doubted of the matter) she told him as before, both her going to the <normalised orig="Phisition" auto="true">Physician</normalised> and the <normalised orig="Phisitions" auto="true">Physicians</normalised> <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> concerning the <normalised orig="Boyes" auto="true">Boys</normalised> <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, which he ouer-hearing, yet said nothing. The next morning, he said <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> the <normalised orig="maide" auto="true">maid</normalised> that made him <normalised orig="readie" auto="true">ready</normalised>, I heard my Aunt tell Iesse Bee, that I was bewitched: the same <normalised orig="Saterday" auto="true">Saturday</normalised> that my <normalised orig="sicknes" auto="true">sickness</normalised> <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> me, I lost my Uncle in the Wood, and in the Coppice I met a little old woman; she had a gray gown with a black fringe about the cape, a broad thrumd hat, and three warts on her face: I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> her begging at our <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>, as for her name I know it not, but by sight I can know her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>. As I passed by her in the Coppice, I chanced (against my will) to let a <normalised orig="scape" auto="true">escape</normalised>; which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> taking in anger <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, Gyp with a <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised>, and fart with a bell: I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to <normalised orig="heauen" auto="true">heaven</normalised>, and thou shalt <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to hell; and forth with she stooped to the ground. I stood still and looked at her, viewing <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> part of her, <normalised orig="meruailing" auto="true">marveling</normalised> what <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> stooped for; so I came home, and she went to Winsell. Hereupon a more vehement <normalised orig="suspition" auto="true">suspicion</normalised> arising some <normalised orig="iudged" auto="true">judged</normalised> it to be the Witch of Stapen-hill: others▪ because she was <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> and went little abroad, rather thought it to be Alice Gooderidge her daughter, who was had in great <normalised orig="suspition" auto="true">suspicion</normalised> of <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> to be a dooer in those <normalised orig="diuellish" auto="true">devilish</normalised> practices, as <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterword</normalised> it <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised>. Thus the <normalised orig="boyes" auto="true">boys</normalised> fits continued daily from the 23 of March till the eight of <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised>, to the great trouble of his Aunt in looking to him and attending on such as came to see him, whereof <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> were of <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> good account.


When in his <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was <normalised orig="depriued" auto="true">deprived</normalised> of the <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of <normalised orig="speach" auto="true">speech</normalised>, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would make <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> of praying, with folded hands, sometime lifting them <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised>, and sometime striking them <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his breast: oft times also in these fits, he wold <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> and amazedly open his eyes, stating and <normalised orig="shriking" auto="true">shrieking</normalised> most <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised>, clapping both his hands <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his face, not being able to <normalised orig="indure" auto="true">endure</normalised> the sight of such <normalised orig="fearfull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> <normalised orig="obiects" auto="true">objects</normalised> as he beheld. On this manner was he tormented in the day, and had reasonable good rest in the night, except through some <normalised orig="fearfull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> <normalised orig="dreames" auto="true">dreams</normalised>; whereunto he was much <normalised orig="subiect" auto="true">subject</normalised>. Being asked if <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> could remember what <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> did when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> made such <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised>? He answered, that <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> he prayed, and <normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> the Cattossed him <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> & <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> in a string. And thus for a good space he could remember, & readily make relation of his troubles.
The <normalised orig="Thursdaye" auto="true">Thursday</normalised> before Caster (<normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> the 8. of <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised>) there came to see the <normalised orig="Boye" auto="true">Boy</normalised> <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Walkeden of Clifton his Grandmother, and <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Saunders his Aunt; to whom when it was told what the Boy <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> conterning the meeting of a woman in the wood, <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Walkeden (<normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the Witches cursing, the <normalised orig="Boyes" auto="true">Boys</normalised> <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> <normalised orig="sicknes" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, his strange handling, & the <normalised orig="Phisitions" auto="true">Physicians</normalised> <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised>) <normalised orig="thoght" auto="true">thought</normalised> it more than probable that the Boy was bewitched: and by the <normalised orig="markes" auto="true">marks</normalised> that he had taken, <normalised orig="perceiued" auto="true">perceived</normalised> that it was Alice Gooderidge which had thus bewitched him; yet making conscience to accuse her till it appeared <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> sure <normalised orig="proofe" auto="true">proof</normalised>, sent for her into the <normalised orig="Towne" auto="true">Town</normalised> to <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> with her <normalised orig="priuately" auto="true">privately</normalised>. When (with much <normalised orig="adoe" auto="true">ado</normalised>) she was came, they brought her into the chamber where the Bay was; at which time, the Boy fell <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> into a <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> sore fit: which being ended, <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Walkeden asked her if she knew that boy? She answered she knew him not. <normalised orig="Manie" auto="true">Many</normalised> other questions were asked; but in <normalised orig="vaine" auto="true">vain</normalised>, for she would not <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> <normalised orig="anye" auto="true">any</normalised> thing. Some of the standers by, <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> the <normalised orig="Boye" auto="true">Boy</normalised> to serateh her: which he did <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the face, and the back of the

hands, so that ye blood came out apace: she stroked the back of her hand <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the child, saying; take blood enough child, God <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> thee. To whom the Boy answered; <normalised orig="praye" auto="true">pray</normalised> for thy <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, thy prayer can do <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> no good. Here by the way touching this <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of scratching the witch: <normalised orig="thogh" auto="true">though</normalised> it be commonly <normalised orig="receiued" auto="true">received</normalised> as an <normalised orig="approued" auto="true">approved</normalised> <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> to <normalised orig="discry" auto="true">descry</normalised> ye witch, and procure case to the bewitched; yet seeing that neither by <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised> cause, or <normalised orig="supernaturall" auto="true">supernatural</normalised> warrant of Gods word it hath <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> such <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> it; it is to be <normalised orig="receaued" auto="true">received</normalised> amongst the witchcrafts, whereof there bee great store <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> in our Land, to the great <normalised orig="dishonor" auto="true">dishonour</normalised> of God. But to our matter. When Robert Toone the <normalised orig="Boyes" auto="true">Boys</normalised> Uncle and his Schoolmaster saw that <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Walkeden could nothing <normalised orig="preuaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised> with this bad woman, they took her aside; to whom (after many questions) she granted, that she was in the Wood that Saturday which the Boy spake of, and that she saw no boy but Sherrats <normalised orig="boye" auto="true">boy</normalised>. Further they demanded of her when she <normalised orig="receiued" auto="true">received</normalised> the Communion? She <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, a <normalised orig="twelue" auto="true">twelve</normalised> month <normalised orig="agoe" auto="true">ago</normalised>. And asking what she <normalised orig="receiued" auto="true">received</normalised>? She answered, her damnation. They asked her whether she knew what she said? She answered <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, what <normalised orig="shuld" auto="true">should</normalised> I <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> but my damnation? They caused her to say the Lords <normalised orig="Praier" auto="true">Prayer</normalised> and the Creed, which she huddled <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> <normalised orig="wyth" auto="true">with</normalised> much <normalised orig="adoo" auto="true">ado</normalised>: but when she came to these words in ye Lords <normalised orig="Praier" auto="true">Prayer</normalised>, And lead vs not into temptation; and in the Creed either to Iesus Christ, The Holy Ghost, or The <normalised orig="Catholicke" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, she would not say <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> of those words. After these examinations, she departed to her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> house. The next day he had <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> sore fits; in the which because he would clap his hands on his face, and shrike <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised>, they asked him the reason thereof at the end of his fit? He answered that the greene Cat which <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> saw had eyes like flames of fire; and that caused him thus fearfully to hide his eyes: & that his <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> (which he <normalised orig="indured" auto="true">endured</normalised>) was very <normalised orig="greeuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised>, like the pricking with daggers or stinging of Bees, which caused

his crying. As this his vexatiō <normalised orig="moued" auto="true">moved</normalised> many that came to see him to shed <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised>, so did it not a little <normalised orig="greeue" auto="true">grieve</normalised> <normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> Uncle Toone; who seeing these fits to increase, thought it good that the Witch were brought before a <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised>: and so went with Iesse Bee (the 10. of <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised>) before M. Tho: Graysley Esquire and <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised> of Peace, <normalised orig="crauing" auto="true">craving</normalised> his Precept to that purpose: which he granted, & directed it to the Constable of Stapen-hill, to bring both this Alice Gooderidge (which was almost 60. <normalised orig="yeres" auto="true">years</normalised> of age) and old Elizabeth Wright also, mother to this, Alice; who had bin 4 or 5. times before him on <normalised orig="suspition" auto="true">suspicion</normalised> of many such crimes. The Precept thus <normalised orig="graunted" auto="true">granted</normalised> forth, they were brought before Ma: Graysley; to whom <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> nothing, <normalised orig="saue" auto="true">save</normalised> that she met a Boy (which she thought to be Sherats boy, who had broken her a basket full of <normalised orig="egges" auto="true">eggs</normalised>) in Abels <normalised orig="Cloase" auto="true">Close</normalised>, and (<normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised>) if my <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> did him <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> hurt, I am sorry: but that word Bell <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did not remember that she <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised>. The next morning when the Boy should rise, his shirt was knit on <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> knots betwixt his legs: and <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> asked how that came? He said be could not tell. All that day he continued in <normalised orig="senseles" auto="true">senseless</normalised> fits▪ with <normalised orig="grieuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> groaning and <normalised orig="fearfull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> <normalised orig="skreaming" auto="true">screaming</normalised>, crying out; <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> where the Witch <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> with three warts <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her face.
The next morning (being Saturday) about six of the <normalised orig="Clocke" auto="true">Clock</normalised> (at which time, his Keepers thinking not the <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised> of his sits to be come, <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> no great care of looking to him) he was <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> <normalised orig="throwne" auto="true">thrown</normalised> <normalised orig="vnder" auto="true">under</normalised> the <normalised orig="bedde" auto="true">bed</normalised>, crying fearfully; Flames of fire flames of fire. Forthwith he got <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the bed, being <normalised orig="fearfull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> and amazed in his countenance. About <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> (at which <normalised orig="tyme" auto="true">time</normalised> his <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> were wont to <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> him) they did now take him in <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> fierce manner till midnight, with greater <normalised orig="extremitie" auto="true">extremity</normalised> than at <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> time before, <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> <normalised orig="sildome" auto="true">seldom</normalised> more intermission than to vomit and <normalised orig="saye" auto="true">say</normalised> (as it was his <normalised orig="vsuall" auto="true">usual</normalised> manner in most <normalised orig="extreamities" auto="true">extremities</normalised>). The Lord bee <normalised orig="praysed" auto="true">praised</normalised>. In


these fits he <normalised orig="shriked" auto="true">shrunk</normalised> <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised> and fearfully, desiring them to take away the <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> Cat. Both now, and most times be made <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> of prayer with folded hands, striking <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his breast.
The 14. of April Sir Humphrey Ferrers and Master Graysley met at Robert Toones, who caused <normalised orig="thether" auto="true">thither</normalised> to bee brought Elizabeth Wright and Alice Gooderidge, together with her husband and daughter. Master Graysley (after some questions concerning his fits) commanded that the Bible should be <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> into the <normalised orig="boyes" auto="true">boys</normalised> <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised>; who began to read the first Chap. of S. Iohns Gospel, till he came to the 4. verse: at which place (when he read) <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> into a most <normalised orig="cruell" auto="true">cruel</normalised> Fit. Presently after which, the old woman Eliza. Wright came into Robert Toones house; which so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as M. Graysley <normalised orig="vnderstood" auto="true">understood</normalised>, he caused her to be <normalised orig="broght" auto="true">brought</normalised> into the <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised> where the Child was: but she was <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="vnwilling" auto="true">unwilling</normalised> to come in, crying, Alas that <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> I was borne, what shall I doo▪ M. Graysley spake loud to her, asking if she could do the boy <normalised orig="anye" auto="true">any</normalised> good▪ She answered that her daughter had that at home, that she should doo good with. He caused her (with much <normalised orig="adoo" auto="true">ado</normalised>) to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the boy: which as <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did, he fell into a strange and <normalised orig="cruell" auto="true">cruel</normalised> fit: Lying <normalised orig="vppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> <normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>, his eyes standing staring open in <normalised orig="fearfull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> manner, his teeth set in his head, his <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> clapped close to his sides, and all the parts of his <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> quaking <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> fearfully. M. Graysley bad her <normalised orig="kneele" auto="true">kneel</normalised> <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> and pray for him; which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did, but so as no <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> could <normalised orig="vnderstand" auto="true">understand</normalised> what she <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>. <normalised orig="Whilest" auto="true">Whilst</normalised> she prayed, the fit continued, and therefore they thrust her out of <normalised orig="doores" auto="true">doors</normalised>; which <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> done, the <normalised orig="boyes" auto="true">boys</normalised> fit ended presently. S. Humphrey and M. Graysley agreed, that <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> women should search the mother & the daughter <normalised orig="seuerally" auto="true">severally</normalised>, to see if they could <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> any such marks on them, as are <normalised orig="vsually" auto="true">usually</normalised> found on witches. The old woman they <normalised orig="stript" auto="true">stripped</normalised> & found behind her right sholder a thing


much like the vdder of an ewe that <normalised orig="giueth" auto="true">gives</normalised> <normalised orig="sucke" auto="true">suck</normalised> with two <normalised orig="teates" auto="true">teats</normalised>, like <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> two great <normalised orig="wartes" auto="true">warts</normalised>, the one <normalised orig="behinde" auto="true">behind</normalised> <normalised orig="vnder" auto="true">under</normalised> her armehole, the other a <normalised orig="handfull" auto="true">handful</normalised> off <normalised orig="towardes" auto="true">towards</normalised> the top of her shoulder: which when they had found, they put on her cloths <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, <normalised orig="leauing" auto="true">leaving</normalised> the place bare, that it might be seen both of sir Humfrey, <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Graisley, and <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> others of good worth, as <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised> it was. They bade her say the Lords prayer, which she <normalised orig="hudled" auto="true">huddled</normalised> <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> after her manner <normalised orig="leauing" auto="true">leaving</normalised> out these <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> still <normalised orig="vnsaide" auto="true">unsaid</normalised>, And <normalised orig="leade" auto="true">lead</normalised> vs not into temptation: being then demanded how long she had those <normalised orig="teates" auto="true">teats</normalised>, she <normalised orig="aunswered" auto="true">answered</normalised> she was borne so. Then did they search Alice Gooderige, and found <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her belly, a hole of the <normalised orig="bignesse" auto="true">bigness</normalised> of two pence, fresh and <normalised orig="bloudy" auto="true">bloody</normalised>, as though some great wart had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> cut off the place. The <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> examined her concerning the bewitching of the Boy, but she would <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> nothing. Then sir Humfrey <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her to the boy, and asked him whether this were <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> that thus bewitched him: he answered that it was surely <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised>: then did sir Humfrey did him scratch her, which when the boy offered to do, his hand was presently <normalised orig="benummed" auto="true">benumbed</normalised> and <normalised orig="pluckt" auto="true">plucked</normalised> to his side, and he tormented in <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> part: <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> se¦uerall times he <normalised orig="assaied" auto="true">assayed</normalised> to do this, but <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised> with like <normalised orig="succes" auto="true">success</normalised>; he was bidden to lay his hand on the standers by, which he did without <normalised orig="difficultie" auto="true">difficulty</normalised>. Then proceeded they in examining her concerning her hurt: she said that she went to fetch <normalised orig="alittle" auto="true">a little</normalised> <normalised orig="meale" auto="true">meal</normalised> on Easter <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> of the chamber, and <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> a ladder, her <normalised orig="foote" auto="true">foot</normalised> slipped, and she <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> a knife in her hand, thrust <normalised orig="herselfe" auto="true">herself</normalised> into the <normalised orig="bellie" auto="true">belly</normalised>: they asked the <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> of a Surgeon, whose <normalised orig="aunswere" auto="true">answer</normalised> was, that it was like to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> so a long time, for it was not festered, and seemed to be sucken. Sir Humfrey charged her with Witchcraft about one Michaels Cow: which Cow when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> brake all <normalised orig="thinges" auto="true">things</normalised> that they tied her in, <normalised orig="ranne" auto="true">ran</normalised> to this Alice Gooderige her house, scraping at the walls and <normalised orig="windowes" auto="true">windows</normalised> to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> come in: her <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> mother Elizabeth


Wright, <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her to help; <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> condition that she might <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> a <normalised orig="peny" auto="true">penny</normalised> to bestow <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her god, and so she came to the mans house kneeled <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> before the Cow, crossed her with a <normalised orig="sticke" auto="true">stick</normalised> in the forehead, and prayed to her god, since which time the Cow continued <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised>. With this she was <normalised orig="vrged" auto="true">urged</normalised> by the <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised>, and with the hurt <normalised orig="vppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her <normalised orig="bellie" auto="true">belly</normalised>, howe it <normalised orig="coulde" auto="true">could</normalised> be so, and her clothes not <normalised orig="cutte" auto="true">cut</normalised>, whereto she made shifting answers, to no purpose. Then put they her aside, and examined Oliuer Gooderidge her husband, and her daughter also, who were found to disagree in their tales concerning that matter: whereupon sir Humfrey committed her to <normalised orig="Darbie" auto="true">Derby</normalised> <normalised orig="Gaole" auto="true">Gaol</normalised>, but dismissed her mother.
The next day the boy had a very <normalised orig="greeuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> fit, in which lying still a while, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="beganne" auto="true">began</normalised> to throw <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> both his <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised> <normalised orig="sodainely" auto="true">suddenly</normalised>, beating them against the ground with great <normalised orig="vehemencie" auto="true">vehemence</normalised>, and at length being in a <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>, he spake saying, <normalised orig="Doost" auto="true">Dost</normalised> thou say thou art my god, and that I am thy <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> <normalised orig="Auoyde" auto="true">Avoid</normalised> <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised>, there is no God <normalised orig="saue" auto="true">save</normalised> the Lord of hosts. <normalised orig="Pawzing" auto="true">Pausing</normalised> a while, at last he said <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, And <normalised orig="wouldest" auto="true">would</normalised> thou <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> me worship a <normalised orig="moulten" auto="true">molten</normalised> calfe?

The next <normalised orig="daie" auto="true">day</normalised> about nine of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> he was cast into a <normalised orig="greeuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised>, and being cast <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>, was bereft of al <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> part of his <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>, and at the length spake saying: <normalised orig="Doost" auto="true">Dost</normalised> thou say I am thy <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised>?

before, if thou torment me 3000. times more, my faith is so strong, that I will worship none but the <normalised orig="liuing" auto="true">living</normalised> God. These <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> being finished, he was cast into three <normalised orig="seuerall" auto="true">several</normalised> <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised>, with all the former torments, drawing together his <normalised orig="ioynts" auto="true">joints</normalised> and sinews, and writhing him, with tossing and turning him very round most <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised>; these fits and speeches continued about <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised>.

While these things <normalised orig="hapned" auto="true">happened</normalised>, it was reported, that the old witch Elizabeth Wright was in the <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised>, a thing somewhat rare; for it is thought, that (except at the time of her former examination) <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was not so <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> in <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> a <normalised orig="yere" auto="true">year</normalised> before: presently they sent for her.

In the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> season came in <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Bagot the <normalised orig="yonger" auto="true">younger</normalised> of Blithfield, wishing to be an <normalised orig="eie" auto="true">eye</normalised> <normalised orig="witnes" auto="true">witness</normalised> of these strange reports, requesting the boy to take the Bible and <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised>, he being unwilling to <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, wished Iesse Bee to do so much, which he did▪ and when he came to the 4. verse of the 1. chapter of S. Iohns gospel in these words, In it was life, and the life was the light of the world, the boy was <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> into a fit. About the end of which it was said that the witch was come, <normalised orig="whome" auto="true">whom</normalised> before they had sent for, so that she was presently brought in, and <normalised orig="stript" auto="true">stripped</normalised> by <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> women, that they might see her suspected place: <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> they stripped her, she cursed the <normalised orig="daie" auto="true">day</normalised> of her birth, making great outcries, and <normalised orig="vsing" auto="true">using</normalised> bitter speeches against all that offered to accuse her. And being asked who brought her to Burton? she said, the <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised>: being asked <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> questions she liked not, she would <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> she did not <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>. Much <normalised orig="adoo" auto="true">ado</normalised> they had to get her to come <normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> the boy, or to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> on him: and it had bin good for him if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> come at him, for so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as she kneeled <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> by him, and cast her <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> him, he was <normalised orig="sodainely" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> taken with such a vehement fit, as before he had <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the like occasion: This was more <normalised orig="greeuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> than <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> other; he lay <normalised orig="vppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>, altogether <normalised orig="depriued" auto="true">deprived</normalised> of the <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> both of his members and senses; except his <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised>, for they <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> wide open very <normalised orig="fearefull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> to the beholders: and all the <normalised orig="partes" auto="true">parts</normalised> of his <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> did quake and shake like Aspen <normalised orig="leaues" auto="true">leaves</normalised>. <normalised orig="Whilest" auto="true">Whilst</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her knees at her <normalised orig="diuellish" auto="true">devilish</normalised> <normalised orig="praiers" auto="true">prayers</normalised>, the child was <normalised orig="greeuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> tormented, therefore they thrust her out of the <normalised orig="doores" auto="true">doors</normalised>. Which being done, he <normalised orig="recouered" auto="true">recovered</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, and his fit ended he said; The Lord be praised: <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Dethicke also of New-hall came in to <normalised orig="beholde" auto="true">behold</normalised> with others these strange sights, at whose request, when Iesse Bee read the first chapter of the gospel after S. Iohn and came to the 4. verse, the boy was cast into a fit like to those which before he had <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the like occasion.

In these his <normalised orig="sittes" auto="true">sits</normalised>, as also in those that he had after, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> could neither <normalised orig="conceale" auto="true">conceal</normalised> what he said, or what <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> to him. The next morning he had two fits betwixt 8. and 12. of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised>, at which time <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> <normalised orig="Graisly" auto="true">Grisly</normalised> came <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to see the child, and <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> he was there, there came in two men of Stapen <normalised orig="hil" auto="true">hill</normalised>, <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> <normalised orig="neighbors" auto="true">neighbours</normalised> to Alice Gooderige, who said they came from <normalised orig="Darbie" auto="true">Derby</normalised>, and were <normalised orig="intreted" auto="true">entreated</normalised> by her to tel Robert Toone, that if he would be good to her, she would <normalised orig="reueale" auto="true">reveal</normalised> the whole <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised> of the matter: and further, they offred him their company thither on <normalised orig="munday" auto="true">monday</normalised>, which was agreed <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> by the <normalised orig="aduise" auto="true">advise</normalised> of M▪ <normalised orig="Graisly" auto="true">Grisly</normalised>. But <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> came, that there was one which being skilful in discerning of witches had bin with Alice Gooderidge at <normalised orig="Darbie" auto="true">Derby</normalised>, and affirmed flatly that she was a witch, offering to make open <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of it, and to cure the boy. This offer Rob. Toone accepting of very willingly, a time was appointed for this mans <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> thither. But to <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> to the boy: about xi. of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised>, he had a sore fit, with the increase of torments groaning very <normalised orig="greeuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised>, and <normalised orig="skreeking" auto="true">screaking</normalised> very pitifully, and being cast <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> with his legs <normalised orig="throwne" auto="true">thrown</normalised> out (as commonly he was) at the last <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> vetered these words; Dost thou say that I am thy Champion? I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> be none of thy champion, I am the <normalised orig="seruant" auto="true">servant</normalised> of the Lord of hosts.

And dost thou say thou wilt torment me twice more <normalised orig="grieuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> than before? Do thy worst <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised>, my trust is in the Lord God. Dost thou say thy <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> will <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> it so?

Forthwith he was <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised> tormented: after which being asked what he saw he answered, the greene Cat (as he <normalised orig="vsually" auto="true">usually</normalised> told them) asking <normalised orig="angerly" auto="true">angrily</normalised>▪ did not you see her?

The mother <normalised orig="vnderstanding" auto="true">understanding</normalised> it, came and asked what the stranger said to him that so troubled him? (for he wept pitifully) The <normalised orig="partie" auto="true">party</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> answered before the boy, I spake no hurt to him. No (<normalised orig="quod" auto="true">quote</normalised> the child) you bade me I should not dissemble, saying that there was no witches: also you asked of me if I thought there were a god? God <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> me fro such cōforters: I pray

you al pray for me that the Lord would <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> from this temptation: at which <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> speaking <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> into a <normalised orig="cruell" auto="true">cruel</normalised> fit; which <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> ended, that man which thought there was no witches departed. But <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Eccarshall the Pastor of Burton being present <normalised orig="staies" auto="true">stays</normalised> still comforting the boy and his <normalised orig="sorrowfull" auto="true">sorrowful</normalised> mother, <normalised orig="perswading" auto="true">persuading</normalised> him that if <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> spake to him again he should not answer him, because he was a liar, and <normalised orig="indeuoured" auto="true">endeavoured</normalised> by his <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> to make the boy <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> him; these things ended about two of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised>, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> remained well till <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised>: then was he <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> into <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> <normalised orig="seuerall" auto="true">several</normalised> fits one presently after another; the last <normalised orig="wherof" auto="true">whereof</normalised> was most intolerable, tossing and tormenting him very <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised>, it seemed by his <normalised orig="lookes" auto="true">looks</normalised> and gestures that the <normalised orig="euill" auto="true">evil</normalised> spirit spake; but because of <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> Eccarsalles <normalised orig="aduise" auto="true">advise</normalised>, he kept a discontented silence, as he told <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterword</normalised> to his mother, but she <normalised orig="aduised" auto="true">advised</normalised> him, that if it should <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, he should not <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> or <normalised orig="forbeare" auto="true">forbear</normalised> to answer it. About this time some <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> was prepared for him, but before he could take it, he was <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> into a crueil fit, wherein after that <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> had <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> a while his rage, he spake saying: Dost thou <normalised orig="saie" auto="true">say</normalised> that I shall worship thee? I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> worship the Lord of hosts <normalised orig="onlie" auto="true">only</normalised>, I charge thee▪ In the name of the father, of the <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> &c. to tell me what thy name is. <normalised orig="Doost" auto="true">Dost</normalised> thou say thou wile not tel me before to morrow? Thou art a liar, I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> found thee so, and I will not <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> thee. Dost thou <normalised orig="saie" auto="true">say</normalised> thou wilt torment me far more <normalised orig="grieuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> than <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> thou hast done? I care not for al that thou caust do <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> me: In the Lord is my trust, who will <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> when his good pleasure is: presently <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> tormented him according to his wonted <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised>. After that fit was ended, and he had a while bin quiet, Iesse Bee persuaded him to be <normalised orig="coragious" auto="true">courageous</normalised>, to take <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> him the shield of faith, and to offer <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> the <normalised orig="combate" auto="true">combat</normalised>. The <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> finding <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> strong in the Lord (whose assistance he had before obtained in his former

conflicts) <normalised orig="condiscended" auto="true">condescended</normalised> to his motion: so Iesse read the first chapt. according to S. Iohn till he came to the 9. ver. That light was the true light, &c. at which words he was <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> into a <normalised orig="meruailous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> sore Fit; which vexed and tormented him in <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> part of his <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>: which being ended, Iesle asked him if he should read agaiue? The boy answered <normalised orig="cherefully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised>, read on in Gods name: so he read <normalised orig="til" auto="true">till</normalised> he came to the 13. verse Which were borne not of blood, &c. At these words he was <normalised orig="throwne" auto="true">thrown</normalised> into <normalised orig="grieuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> torments, like to the former: which ended, Iesse asked if he should read still? The boy answered, proceed in the name of God. Then read he the 14 ver. The same Word became flesh &c. At which words he was tormented the third time; yet not so vehemently as before. He proceeding forward read till be came to the 17 ver. The law was <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> by Moses, grace and truth came by Iesus Christ. <normalised orig="Foorthwith" auto="true">Forthwith</normalised> he fell into the fourth fit, the feeblest of <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> he yet had; <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised> no doubt finding his force quatling, and his <normalised orig="fierie" auto="true">fiery</normalised> darts quenched. So <normalised orig="Ieste" auto="true">Jest</normalised> read on, the Child cheerfully & <normalised orig="attentiuely" auto="true">attentively</normalised> hearkening till he had finished the chapter without <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> trouble to him. The next day (among other fits) he had one much more vehement than the rest, his torments being increased and his strength so great, that two strong men were not able to rule him. After this fit Iesse Bee said; Come Thomas, shall we <normalised orig="prouoke" auto="true">provoke</normalised> him to <normalised orig="battell" auto="true">battle</normalised>? To whom the child answered▪ yes <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> willingly. So they looked for the Bible, but the <normalised orig="boyes" auto="true">boys</normalised> Uncle had taken it to the Church. Then did the Boy desire Iesse to <normalised orig="resolue" auto="true">resolve</normalised> him in this doubt, whether it were <normalised orig="hurtfull" auto="true">hurtful</normalised> for one to <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> or <normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised> before <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. Being satisfied concerning this Point, and casting <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> his head to call to remembrance some thing else <normalised orig="wherof" auto="true">whereof</normalised> doubted doubted▪ he was on the <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> into a <normalised orig="grieuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> fit, groaning and <normalised orig="skreaming" auto="true">screaming</normalised> most <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised>, turning as round on all <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised>, as a <normalised orig="pigge" auto="true">pig</normalised> on a spit; and <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> (doe what the

keepers could) he leaped <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> to the top of the bed, catching hold on the <normalised orig="testern" auto="true">tester</normalised> with his hands & hanging by his <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> notwithstanding his eyes were <normalised orig="cloased" auto="true">closed</normalised> <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised>: & being in this case, he said; dost than say I shall hear <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> within these 2. or 3. <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>? I pray God it be good <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised>. He was at last cast into a <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>, <normalised orig="vttering" auto="true">uttering</normalised> <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> such comfortable speeches, as in other his <normalised orig="traunces" auto="true">trances</normalised> he did. This day there came one to them, <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> been (of her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> accord) <normalised orig="wyth" auto="true">with</normalised> <normalised orig="widdow" auto="true">widow</normalised> Worthington the good Witch of Hoppers (as they call her) and told them, she said the Boy was bewitched; yet help him she could not, except his mother or some of his <normalised orig="neerest" auto="true">nearest</normalised> <normalised orig="frends" auto="true">friends</normalised> came <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> her. The same answer was <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> by a Witch about Couentrey to another, looking for some <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> in the <normalised orig="boyes" auto="true">boys</normalised> <normalised orig="behalfe" auto="true">behalf</normalised>. But the mother of the <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> (detesting the <normalised orig="diuells" auto="true">devils</normalised> <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised>) thanked those two for their <normalised orig="kindnes" auto="true">kindness</normalised> towards <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised>, but sharply <normalised orig="reprooued" auto="true">reproved</normalised> them for attempting a thing so <normalised orig="vnlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised>. After these fits, he rested reasonable quiet <normalised orig="til" auto="true">till</normalised> the next day: when as about one a clock (seeming <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> well) he rceiued some <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised>. But <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> to be a right <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised>, <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> a sore <normalised orig="enemie" auto="true">enemy</normalised> to the <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised>, (<normalised orig="enuying" auto="true">envying</normalised> the good of his <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>, when he saw <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> <normalised orig="vnable" auto="true">unable</normalised> to hurt his <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>) did let his digesting of it (as <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> times <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> did) by casting him presently into <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> fits; which as (<normalised orig="vsually" auto="true">usually</normalised> all his fits did) lasting about <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> a quarter of an <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised>, ended with a vomit. <normalised orig="Manie" auto="true">Many</normalised> that were Beholders of the Childes torments, little hoped that <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> he could <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="liued" auto="true">lived</normalised> or <normalised orig="recouered" auto="true">recovered</normalised>. But God be praised, that <normalised orig="Sathans" auto="true">Sedans</normalised> power is <normalised orig="limitted" auto="true">limited</normalised> by him who is Lord both of life and death.
When these Conflicts were ended, Iesse Bee said <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> him, Thomas shall wee take the Sword with two edges, and bid <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> the <normalised orig="Battayle" auto="true">Battle</normalised>? The <normalised orig="Boye" auto="true">Boy</normalised> (<normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> well <normalised orig="acquaynted" auto="true">acquainted</normalised> with the phrase) answered; If you will read, I will gladly <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>. So he read the first Chapter of S. Iohns <normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised> which <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> he was reading the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>


was <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> into three <normalised orig="Fittes" auto="true">Fits</normalised>. After these Fits, he was <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="cheerfull" auto="true">cheerful</normalised>, and desirous to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised>, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> might read <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>: which <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> did. And when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> came at the fifth verse of the first Chapter of the <normalised orig="Reuelation" auto="true">Revelation</normalised> (for that Chapter he read) he was <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> into a <normalised orig="cruell" auto="true">cruel</normalised> <normalised orig="Fitte" auto="true">Fit</normalised>: which <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> ended, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> to Iesse Bee, <normalised orig="intreating" auto="true">entreating</normalised> him <normalised orig="carnestly" auto="true">earnestly</normalised> to read on forward. So Iesse Bee finished the Chapter, and read also the second and was <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> (in reading them▪ with <normalised orig="anye" auto="true">any</normalised> more of the <normalised orig="Boies" auto="true">Boys</normalised> fits) interrupted.
Upon the one <normalised orig="aud" auto="true">and</normalised> twentieth of <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised>, though betwixt nine of the <normalised orig="Clocke" auto="true">Clock</normalised> in the Morning, and two in the <normalised orig="Afternoone" auto="true">Afternoon</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had <normalised orig="tenne" auto="true">ten</normalised> <normalised orig="Fittes" auto="true">Fits</normalised>, yet the last of them was most <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised>; in the <normalised orig="middest" auto="true">midst</normalised> of it <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would open his eyes amazedly, and presently clap both his hands <normalised orig="vppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> them, <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> into most violent torments throughout all the parts of his <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>; and <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> cast <normalised orig="vppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> <normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>, he <normalised orig="threwe" auto="true">threw</normalised> <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> his <normalised orig="legges" auto="true">legs</normalised> fiercely, beating them against the ground vehemently: and after that lying in a quiet <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> opened his mouth, saying; Dost thou <normalised orig="saye" auto="true">say</normalised> that thou wilt <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> a <normalised orig="Crowne" auto="true">Crown</normalised>, if I will worship thee? I regard thee not nor thy <normalised orig="Crowne" auto="true">Crown</normalised>; for the <normalised orig="Lorde" auto="true">Lord</normalised> hath <normalised orig="reserued" auto="true">reserved</normalised> a <normalised orig="Crowne" auto="true">Crown</normalised> of <normalised orig="righteousnesse" auto="true">righteousness</normalised> for <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> in <normalised orig="Heauen" auto="true">Heaven</normalised>.

Then (pausing awhile) <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> spake again saying; Dost thou <normalised orig="saye" auto="true">say</normalised> thou wilt <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> <normalised orig="Townes" auto="true">Towns</normalised> and <normalised orig="Countreyes" auto="true">Countries</normalised>, if I will worship thee? Away <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> away, thou art a <normalised orig="lyar" auto="true">liar</normalised>, and the Father of <normalised orig="lyes" auto="true">lies</normalised>; I will not <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> thee: away. <normalised orig="Foorthwith" auto="true">Forthwith</normalised> his mouth was <normalised orig="cloased" auto="true">closed</normalised> <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised>, and <normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> teeth set fast in his head, insomuch that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> laboured to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> opened them with his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> hands, but he could not; yet when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had <normalised orig="remayned" auto="true">remained</normalised> awhile thus, the Lord (by his <normalised orig="almightie" auto="true">almighty</normalised> power) opened his mouth, and he boldly <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>; I charge thee (<normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised>) in the name of the Father and of the <normalised orig="Sonne" auto="true">Son</normalised>.

At which word his mouth was fast closed <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, yet was it not long before the <normalised orig="Lorde" auto="true">Lord</normalised> (by his power) opened it <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>. So he proceeded, saying; I charge thee tell <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> what is thy <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> name? <normalised orig="Saist" auto="true">Say</normalised> thou thou wilt not? and <normalised orig="doost" auto="true">dost</normalised> thou say thou wilt torment me ten times more? No sooner <normalised orig="wer" auto="true">were</normalised> these words spoken, but he was tormented <normalised orig="aboue" auto="true">above</normalised> measure. Next day betwixt ten and one of the clock, he had two <normalised orig="ordinarie" auto="true">ordinary</normalised> fits, and at the loose of those, one <normalised orig="extraordinarie" auto="true">extraordinary</normalised>; in the which <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> <normalised orig="vppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his back, with his accustomed torments, he <normalised orig="vttred" auto="true">uttered</normalised> these words Wouldll thou <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> me worship thee, thou liar, thou wicked wretch? thou art the father of all lies. I charge thee get from me, away, away. These words he <normalised orig="vttred" auto="true">uttered</normalised> disdainfully, shaking his hands at him. And after he had paused a while, he said, Dost thou promise me all my desire▪ If I will worship thee? Ah wicked tempter, I charge <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> in the name of the Father, &c. to tell me thy <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> name? These words he <normalised orig="vttred" auto="true">uttered</normalised> with an interrupted <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised>: but repeated them presently <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="couragiously" auto="true">courageously</normalised>: saying also, And dost thou say thy <normalised orig="Mistres" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> hath <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> thee a draught of her blood? I am glad of it: for then shall I <normalised orig="knowe" auto="true">know</normalised> her shortly. And dost thou say thou wilt torment me twice more? At these words he was cast into two sore fits; so that <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised> kept promise with him. His torments caused him <normalised orig="skreame" auto="true">scream</normalised> <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="lowd" auto="true">loud</normalised> and <normalised orig="groane" auto="true">groan</normalised> <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised>, slinging out his hands as though he fought with <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised>▪ and stamping fiercely, as if he <normalised orig="trode" auto="true">trod</normalised> him <normalised orig="vnder" auto="true">under</normalised> <normalised orig="foote" auto="true">foot</normalised>. This combat ended, he lay <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised> about a quarter of an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised>, & then <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> been a while tormented, lying on his <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>, he said; Dost thou say because I vex thy <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> thou wilt torment <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> more? Which words being spoke, he was cast into such torments, as <normalised orig="wer" auto="true">were</normalised> <normalised orig="grieuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> to the beholders. And <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> <normalised orig="ouercome" auto="true">overcome</normalised> the <normalised orig="extremitie" auto="true">extremity</normalised> of the same, he spake (with his eyes shut) saying; What, <normalised orig="doost" auto="true">dost</normalised> thou <normalised orig="saye" auto="true">say</normalised> I shall worship thee thou hast no faith <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised>, I will fight with thee with the word of the

euerliuing god, <normalised orig="Auoid" auto="true">Avoid</normalised>, <normalised orig="auoid" auto="true">avoid</normalised>; I charge thee in gods name to get thee hence. Again after more fits he said; what, dost thou say thou wilt make <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> as strong as a Giant, and as rich as the greatest Potentate in ye world, if I will worship thee? the Lord my God can make me strong, & <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> all good things. <normalised orig="Hauing" auto="true">Having</normalised> paused a <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised>, be spake again, saying; dost thou say if I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> not worship thee thou wilt make me a four-footed beast? that <normalised orig="lieth" auto="true">lies</normalised> not in thy power, since God hath made me a reasonable creature: my faith <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised> is strong. And, <normalised orig="doost" auto="true">dost</normalised> thou say thou wilt torment <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> <normalised orig="grieuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> for thy <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> sake? Forthwith he was <normalised orig="grieuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> tormented, crying out, A <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised>, a <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised>: his mouth was stretched out, and he rored fiercely like a <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised>, crying out, he <normalised orig="teareth" auto="true">tears</normalised> me, he <normalised orig="teareth" auto="true">tears</normalised> me. These torments ended, he lay amazedly, with the sweat running <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> his face. Being <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> tormented, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> spake saying; wilt thou <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> a land full of all <normalised orig="frutes" auto="true">fruit</normalised> if I will worship thee? the Lord in <normalised orig="heauen" auto="true">heaven</normalised> hath goods enough for me: thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> send a be are thy helhound to torment me: thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> tell <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> I should <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> within 2. or 3. <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised>; dost thou say thy <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> hath commanded thee not to be an <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised> from tormenting me, because I vex her? is that thy <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised>? At these words he was presently cast into <normalised orig="grieuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> torments, starting amazedly and crying out; Flames of fire, flames of consuming fire: he threw away all things he could <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> by groping (for his eyes were shut) and <normalised orig="wownd" auto="true">wound</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> close in the bed clothes. Scarcely had these torments an end, but others began; wherein being <normalised orig="grieuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> afflicted, he <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> out, A <normalised orig="fierie" auto="true">fiery</normalised> dragon, a <normalised orig="fierie" auto="true">fiery</normalised> dragon. These torments continuing, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> said; now thou <normalised orig="foule" auto="true">foul</normalised> fiend, now thou <normalised orig="shewest" auto="true">show</normalised> thy self in thy <normalised orig="likenes" auto="true">likeness</normalised>. Presently he <normalised orig="strooke" auto="true">struck</normalised> both his hands <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his face, <normalised orig="shriking" auto="true">shrieking</normalised> and crying fearfully, A <normalised orig="flye" auto="true">fly</normalised>, a <normalised orig="flye" auto="true">fly</normalised>. Being asked what he had <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> in these conflicts? <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> answered, <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> & <normalised orig="fearfull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> things, but <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised> them not; neither could tell he spake, <normalised orig="thogh" auto="true">though</normalised> he <normalised orig="cald" auto="true">called</normalised> to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> a thing

spake to him. The 24 day about 11 of the clock he fell in to an <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> fit, which <normalised orig="shooke" auto="true">shook</normalised> him <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised> in all parts of his <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>, making him to are like a <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised>. Being asked after the fit what he had <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised>? he answered a great <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised> came roaring <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> him. <normalised orig="Foure" auto="true">Four</normalised> fits more he had before 4. of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised>; at which time Ma. <normalised orig="Edw" auto="true">Adieu</normalised>: Cockin came into the house, and finding him well, bade him read the 12. of Iohn: which he did, till he came to the 15. verse I am glad for your sakes, that &c and then was he cast into a fit presently. Upon this there came in another, <normalised orig="disiring" auto="true">desiring</normalised> to see the like <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised>: so the Boy read till he came to the 25▪ ve. I am the resurrection &c. at which words he was <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised>. This desire that <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> had to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> the boy read, that they might see him in his fits, sauou•d but of a tempting <normalised orig="curiositie" auto="true">curiosity</normalised>, and is not warrantable. But to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> on. The <normalised orig="Boyes" auto="true">Boys</normalised> torments continuing, Rob: Toone being altogether without hope of his <normalised orig="recouerie" auto="true">recovery</normalised>; both because the Witch confessed nothing, and the man that promised help failed, whereat he <normalised orig="greeued" auto="true">grieved</normalised> exceedingly. <normalised orig="Manie" auto="true">Many</normalised> <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> him to send to <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> Witches, which he refused; but <normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> wife purposed to attempt it, and sent for a messenger, who had before been <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised> by others in the like <normalised orig="busines" auto="true">business</normalised>. He found the Boy in a fit when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> came; and thereupon <normalised orig="vttered" auto="true">uttered</normalised> these words; who would suffer him to lye thus; & not <normalised orig="seeke" auto="true">seek</normalised> <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> could get? Whereuntoo, an honest man (not acquainted with their purpose) answered; To <normalised orig="seeke" auto="true">seek</normalised> <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> at a Witch, is wicked and dangerous. The messenger was pricked in conscience with his speech, and would not <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>. <normalised orig="Ro" auto="true">To</normalised>: Toone was not a <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> glad they were stopped in so <normalised orig="vnlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised> an enterprise. This day also another had been with <normalised orig="widdow" auto="true">widow</normalised> Worthington the Witch of Hoppers, (<normalised orig="vnknowen" auto="true">unknown</normalised> to the <normalised orig="Boyes" auto="true">Boys</normalised> <normalised orig="Frends" auto="true">Friends</normalised>▪ and brought this <normalised orig="aunswere" auto="true">answer</normalised>; that <normalised orig="vnlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> the <normalised orig="Boye" auto="true">Boy</normalised> and his <normalised orig="Frends" auto="true">Friends</normalised> <normalised orig="beleeued" auto="true">believed</normalised> her, she could do him no good: which thing they detested.

The <normalised orig="sixe" auto="true">six</normalised> and twentieth of <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised> (after nine <normalised orig="fittes" auto="true">fits</normalised> in the morning) about one of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> he was <normalised orig="ouerthrowne" auto="true">overthrown</normalised> into a <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> sore <normalised orig="Fitte" auto="true">Fit</normalised>, and in the same was <normalised orig="greeuouslye" auto="true">grievously</normalised> vexed and tormented. At the last <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> spake thus; What <normalised orig="doost" auto="true">dost</normalised> thou <normalised orig="saye" auto="true">say</normalised>, if I will worship thee, thou wilt make me a God: but if I will not, thou wilt make me a toad? It <normalised orig="lieth" auto="true">lies</normalised> not in thy power <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised> to make me what thou wilt; but in the power of my Creator. And <normalised orig="doost" auto="true">dost</normalised> thou say thou wilt torment me twice? do thy worst, the Lord is my trust, and I know he can and <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> me. Being then <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> tormented, he did struggle most fiercely, roaring fearfully like a <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised>, crying A <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised>, a <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised>; and by and by, A dragon, a dragon. After this, he was quiet about a quarter of an <normalised orig="hower" auto="true">hour</normalised> and then (<normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised>) fell into the like torments, and spake (as before) saying; dost thou say thou hast brought <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> good <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised>? I <normalised orig="praye" auto="true">pray</normalised> God it bee. And <normalised orig="doost" auto="true">dost</normalised> thou say if I will curse God, thou wilt releease me of all my <normalised orig="paynes" auto="true">pains</normalised> and <normalised orig="tormentes" auto="true">torments</normalised>? What <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised>, <normalised orig="wouldest" auto="true">would</normalised> thou <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> curse my <normalised orig="Creatour" auto="true">Creator</normalised>, which spared not to send his <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> begotten <normalised orig="Sonne" auto="true">Son</normalised> Iesus Christ out of his <normalised orig="bosome" auto="true">bosom</normalised>, to shed his most precious Blood for my Sins? Ah wicked Tempter, I charge thee in the name of the Father, the <normalised orig="Sonne" auto="true">Son</normalised>, and the Holy Ghost, to tell me what is thy <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> name? <normalised orig="Doost" auto="true">Dost</normalised> thou <normalised orig="saye" auto="true">say</normalised>, thy <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> hath rewarded thee, and therefore thou wilt torment <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> more than <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> thou <normalised orig="diddest" auto="true">did</normalised>? I care not for thee a <normalised orig="Strawe" auto="true">Straw</normalised>: what <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised>, seek not to insult in thy <normalised orig="subtile" auto="true">subtle</normalised> cruelties: for the Lord will release <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> from thee when his god <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> and pleasure is; and so (with some more torments) this Fit ended.
The next day he came that promised to cure the Boy, and to <normalised orig="prooue" auto="true">prove</normalised> her plainly (which was had in <normalised orig="suspition" auto="true">suspicion</normalised>) to be a Witch. He wished Robert Toone <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to procure him a warrant to fetch her from the <normalised orig="Gaole" auto="true">Gaol</normalised>: promising, as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> hated all <normalised orig="Coniuration" auto="true">Conjuration</normalised> and <normalised orig="Inchauntment" auto="true">Enchantment</normalised>, so it should

bee manifest what course <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> for effecting those matters. This <normalised orig="daye" auto="true">day</normalised> and both the next he had <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> sore fits. Upon the last of April, beeween 9. and 3 in the <normalised orig="afternoone" auto="true">afternoon</normalised> he had 14 fits At this time the witches <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised> being procured, she came to <normalised orig="Towne" auto="true">Town</normalised>, and was brought to the <normalised orig="Boye" auto="true">Boy</normalised>: to whom she said, God <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> thee my <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>; <normalised orig="whereuppon" auto="true">whereupon</normalised> he was presently cast into most strange torments, differing both in manner and <normalised orig="crueltie" auto="true">cruelty</normalised> from the former. Three strong men could hardly hold him, he was so strong; he <normalised orig="shriked" auto="true">shrunk</normalised> pitifully, blearing out the <normalised orig="tung" auto="true">tongue</normalised>, and <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> his neck so wrythen, that his face seemed to stand backward. This <normalised orig="pitifull" auto="true">pitiful</normalised> spectacle did wring <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised> from the beholders. So from 3. till 9. at night he had 27. of these torments; & then they left him quaking and <normalised orig="meruailously" auto="true">marvelously</normalised> dismayed. These fits being <normalised orig="layd" auto="true">laid</normalised> to the Witches charge: she answered, that she indeed did vex the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, but if they would <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised> her, it should cease. Two or three went to Stapen-hill to see what the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> woman did this while; suspecting she had a hand herein: when they came <normalised orig="thether" auto="true">thither</normalised>, they found her on her knees; praying (no doubt) to the <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised>. Upon the first of May, about 7. in the morning, he was cast into a fit. This was the <normalised orig="daye" auto="true">day</normalised> wherein the Cunning man would make the Witch <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>, and a <normalised orig="sennight" auto="true">seven-night</normalised> after cure the Boy: so <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> sent for her from the <normalised orig="Towne" auto="true">Town</normalised> Hal to Rob: Toones, where <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> worshipful Personages were <normalised orig="readie" auto="true">ready</normalised> to see <normalised orig="proofe" auto="true">proof</normalised> of his skill. Being brought they laboured to make her <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> voluntarily: to whom she answered, this was ye first that <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> she committed; and if they would procure her <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> offered to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> all the truth freely. Presently her speech was interrupted, so that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could not <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>▪ but she <normalised orig="praied" auto="true">prayed</normalised> them to <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised> her. Then the man seeing this would not <normalised orig="preuaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised>, fell to <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of his conclusion: <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> put a <normalised orig="paire" auto="true">pair</normalised> of new <normalised orig="shooes" auto="true">shoes</normalised> on her <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised>, setting her close to the fire, till the <normalised orig="shooes" auto="true">shoes</normalised> being <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> hot, might <normalised orig="constrayne" auto="true">constrain</normalised> her thorough increase of the <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised> to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>.

This was his ridiculous practise, she being throghly heated desired a release and she would disclose al; which granted, she confessed nothing. Being therefore <normalised orig="threatned" auto="true">threatened</normalised> more sharply, she offered to <normalised orig="reueale" auto="true">reveal</normalised> all <normalised orig="priuatly" auto="true">privately</normalised> to <normalised orig="mistresse" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Dethicke, and going with her into a parlour; when she began to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> her <normalised orig="winde" auto="true">wind</normalised> was stopped, so as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could not say any thing, but, I pray you <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised> me. By this it was xi. of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised>, and the boy had had 8. fits, and was brought into the parlour where she was, who said, Thomas, I pray you <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised>, and be good to <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised>. At which words <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> fell into a <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> sore fit. After which, the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> continued <normalised orig="threatning" auto="true">threatening</normalised> and persuading <normalised orig="hir" auto="true">his</normalised>, but al she would say▪ was, she was <normalised orig="sorie" auto="true">sorry</normalised> for him, for she <normalised orig="mistooke" auto="true">mistook</normalised> him, thinking him to be Sherrats boy, thinking to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> bin <normalised orig="reuenged" auto="true">revenged</normalised> on him for breaking her <normalised orig="egges" auto="true">eggs</normalised>. When they saw they could <normalised orig="preuaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised> no more, they sent her <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to the Hall, and the company departed: after which the boy had 8. fits.
The next morning went Ierome Horabin, Edward Weightman, <normalised orig="mistris" auto="true">mistress</normalised> Caldwall with other to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> what confession she would make. At whose <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> she spake thus; I met the boy in the wood, the first <normalised orig="saterday" auto="true">saturday</normalised> in Lent, and passing by me, he called me witch of Stapen <normalised orig="hil" auto="true">hill</normalised>: <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> whom I said, <normalised orig="Euery" auto="true">Every</normalised> boy doth call me witch, but did I <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> make thy arse to itch? Further <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, I pray you get help for the boy, for Gods sake get help for the boy. <normalised orig="Againe" auto="true">Again</normalised> she said, God <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> grace to <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> the <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised>. And when she would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> spoken on, she said, I cannot, I cannot, my <normalised orig="winde" auto="true">wind</normalised> is stopped: <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Caldwall asked her if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would be prayed for? Yes (quoth she) I pray you desire M. Eccarsall to pray for me, that the Lord would open my hart, that I may <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> the truth. The 3. of <normalised orig="Maie" auto="true">May</normalised> in the morning, Rob. Toone, <normalised orig="Edw" auto="true">Adieu</normalised>. Weightman, Rich▪ <normalised orig="Teate" auto="true">Teat</normalised> and others, went <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to examine the witch, who confessed to them saying: The first <normalised orig="satterday" auto="true">saturday</normalised> in Leut toward <normalised orig="euening" auto="true">evening</normalised> I met the boy in the wood, and he called me

witch of Stapen <normalised orig="hil" auto="true">hill</normalised>: and I <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> boy <normalised orig="dooth" auto="true">doth</normalised> call me witch, but did I <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> make thy arse to itch? <normalised orig="foorthwith" auto="true">forthwith</normalised> I stouped to the ground, and the <normalised orig="Diuell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> appeared to me in <normalised orig="likenesse" auto="true">likeness</normalised> of a little partie-colored dog red and white, and I called him <normalised orig="Minny" auto="true">Mini</normalised>, seeing that <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> boy <normalised orig="calleth" auto="true">calls</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> witch, therefore <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> thy <normalised orig="waies" auto="true">ways</normalised> and torment this boy in <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> part of his <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> at thine <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> pleasure, <normalised orig="foorthwith" auto="true">forthwith</normalised> I strained <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> part of my <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>, enforcing my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> to vomit, saying; After this sort, <normalised orig="vexe" auto="true">vex</normalised> <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> part of him. Further (said she) the dog followed the boy to Burton, and as I returned from Winsell (whither I went to <normalised orig="buie" auto="true">buy</normalised> a <normalised orig="groates" auto="true">groats</normalised> worth of <normalised orig="egges" auto="true">eggs</normalised>) he met me <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, telling me he had fulfilled my request, and at my yards end he departed from me; since when he hath bin <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> times with <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> at <normalised orig="Darbie" auto="true">Derby</normalised> <normalised orig="Gaole" auto="true">Gaol</normalised>, and these two nights at Burton Hall, and continually he scratcheth my head, & scrapeth in the straw. <normalised orig="Againe" auto="true">Again</normalised> she said, the boy will not mend except you seek for help: you may <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> help enough: she would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> spoken further, but something stopped her throat, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, come out thou <normalised orig="foule" auto="true">foul</normalised> serpent. From 8. <normalised orig="til" auto="true">till</normalised> 2 the boy had 12 sore fits with pitiful groaning: at 3 came M. Hildersham of Ashby de la Zouch▪ with <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> other godly ministers M. Hildersham after that by <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> questions, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had made <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of the boys faith, said openly, that <normalised orig="howsoeuer" auto="true">howsoever</normalised> the Papists boasted much of the power their priests had to cast out <normalised orig="diuells" auto="true">devils</normalised>, and the simple <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> where noted it as a great discredit to the Ministers of the Gospel, that they do want this power, yet did he <normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised> there was no such gift in them, that <normalised orig="thogh" auto="true">though</normalised> the Lord oft in these <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised>, by the <normalised orig="praiers" auto="true">prayers</normalised> of the faithful casts eut <normalised orig="diuels" auto="true">devils</normalised>, yet could he not assure them to cure him. To <normalised orig="holde" auto="true">hold</normalised> this faith of <normalised orig="myracles" auto="true">miracles</normalised> to remainestill in the church, is an opinion dangerous. That seeing to be <normalised orig="passessed" auto="true">possessed</normalised> is but a <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised> correction, & such as whereby both the <normalised orig="glorie" auto="true">glory</normalised> of God and the <normalised orig="saluation" auto="true">salvation</normalised> of the <normalised orig="partie" auto="true">party</normalised> may be furthered, it can not without <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised> be absolutely

prayed against: al which notwithstanding, that there is a good <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of <normalised orig="praier" auto="true">prayer</normalised> in such a case, and of fasting also, to procure that the <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> may be sanctified to the beholders, and the possessed <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>; yea to obtain that he may be <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> also from it, if the Lord see it be best for his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="glorie" auto="true">glory</normalised>. In which <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised>, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> being the mouth of the rest, they all prayed, during which time the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> was not interrupted.
Whereas Alice Gooderige said her familiar was like one William Gregories dog of Stapenhill, there arose a <normalised orig="rumor" auto="true">rumour</normalised>, his dog was her familiar: wherefore <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> with his neighbour <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">master</normalised> <normalised orig="Coxe" auto="true">Cox</normalised> went the next day to <normalised orig="examin" auto="true">examine</normalised> her concerning this report; and she <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, my <normalised orig="diuel" auto="true">devil</normalised> (I say) was like your dog. Now out <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> thee (<normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="Gregorie" auto="true">Gregory</normalised>) and departed: she being further examined, <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised> she had her familiar of her mother. The <normalised orig="sixt" auto="true">sixth</normalised> of <normalised orig="Maie" auto="true">May</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had xii. fits in the <normalised orig="forenoone" auto="true">forenoon</normalised>, and x. in the <normalised orig="afternoone" auto="true">afternoon</normalised>; these last were as <normalised orig="greeuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> as <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> before. After one of them taking the chamber pot, he started <normalised orig="sodainely" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> saying, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> where a man <normalised orig="commeth" auto="true">comes</normalised> out of the chamber pot. In another <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised> he cried out, Flames of fire, flames of fire: and in another he said, I see the <normalised orig="heauens" auto="true">heavens</normalised> open. In the most of these fits <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> bleared out his tongue very <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised>, <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> his face wrythen towards his <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>, groaning and <normalised orig="shriking" auto="true">shrieking</normalised> lamentably; being asked if he <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised> what was done; he said, it <normalised orig="seemd" auto="true">seemed</normalised> to him he was <normalised orig="wroong" auto="true">wrong</normalised> and tossed <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> and <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>▪ after these fits he remained <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> <normalised orig="til" auto="true">till</normalised> next morning. On friday he was by 7 a <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> cast into a fit; but about 8 he fell into <normalised orig="maruellous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> strange torments, both for continuance and extraordinary cruelty, his tong thrust out of his head, his mouth drawn awry, first toward one <normalised orig="eare" auto="true">ear</normalised>, then to another; his face very strangely disfigured. In his <normalised orig="extreamitie" auto="true">extremity</normalised> he made <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> to the standers by to pray; and <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> by folded hands and other gestures, <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> testimony that the spirit of God was mightily laboring against his infirmities.

By and by his <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> opened, & what <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> he <normalised orig="catcht" auto="true">caught</normalised> he (as it <normalised orig="seemd" auto="true">seemed</normalised>) threw it against <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised>, and strait they being shut <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> again, so that he could not open them with his fingers, which he <normalised orig="indeuoured" auto="true">endeavoured</normalised>, his mouth was opened, & he said, O pray pray, <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> more need to pray; so the company <normalised orig="ioynd" auto="true">joined</normalised> in humble & <normalised orig="harty" auto="true">hearty</normalised> <normalised orig="praier" auto="true">prayer</normalised>: but he hearing them not (<normalised orig="thogh" auto="true">though</normalised> they <normalised orig="praied" auto="true">prayed</normalised> <normalised orig="lowd" auto="true">loud</normalised>) <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>; <normalised orig="whie" auto="true">why</normalised> do you not pray? Presently his mouth being shut, and his teeth set fast in his head, he <normalised orig="stampt" auto="true">stamped</normalised> (as it were) in triumph of <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised>, and lifting his hands towards <normalised orig="heauen" auto="true">heaven</normalised>, stroke them with <normalised orig="reuerence" auto="true">reverence</normalised> on his breast. <normalised orig="Sathans" auto="true">Sedans</normalised> raging against him did increase in such <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> as caused the beholders to <normalised orig="shead" auto="true">shed</normalised> tears abundantly, for they could no sooner <normalised orig="imagin" auto="true">imagine</normalised> a ceasing, but strait his fit began <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>: and this conflict lasted long, in which space, he oft <normalised orig="vttered" auto="true">uttered</normalised> these words; do what thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised>, this <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> doe thee no good: Is it so? and such like. And after obtaining the <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of his <normalised orig="tung" auto="true">tongue</normalised>, he proceeded saying, <normalised orig="Auoyde" auto="true">Avoid</normalised> <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised>, I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> my head the helmet of <normalised orig="saluation" auto="true">salvation</normalised>, and I am girded about with <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised>. Iesus Christ hath <normalised orig="shead" auto="true">shed</normalised> water and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> for my sins, & I sweat but water. O Lord thy apostles were <normalised orig="whipt" auto="true">whipped</normalised> & scourged for thy <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised>, & they departed, <normalised orig="reioycing" auto="true">rejoicing</normalised> that they were accounted <normalised orig="woorthy" auto="true">worthy</normalised> to suffer for thy names sake. And now (O <normalised orig="Lorde" auto="true">Lord</normalised>) I <normalised orig="reioyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> that thou accountest me <normalised orig="woorthie" auto="true">worthy</normalised> to suffer these <normalised orig="cruell" auto="true">cruel</normalised> torments. Presently he <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> into torment <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>; at the last lying on his <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> quietly, he desired the standers by to sing the <normalised orig="sixt" auto="true">sixth</normalised> <normalised orig="psalme" auto="true">psalm</normalised>, and so they did, he singing with them <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="cheerefully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised>. While they were singing, he oft was interrupted and <normalised orig="ioynd" auto="true">joined</normalised> with them <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> toward the <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised>: <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> <normalised orig="laine" auto="true">lain</normalised> in a trance, so that they could scarcely <normalised orig="perceiue" auto="true">perceive</normalised> <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> motion, he said; I see the <normalised orig="heauens" auto="true">heavens</normalised> open, hearken, I <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> a <normalised orig="heauenlie" auto="true">heavenly</normalised> noise, and lying still a while, he met with them at the 10. ver. And now my foes, that (<normalised orig="qd" auto="true">quoth</normalised> he) is <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised> and so continued singing <normalised orig="til" auto="true">till</normalised> the <normalised orig="psalme" auto="true">psalm</normalised> was ended: all the <normalised orig="psalme" auto="true">psalm</normalised> <normalised orig="throgh" auto="true">through</normalised> he sweat exceedingly, & dried his face as if

he had not bin in his fit. After this, he desired them to pray for him whilst he lay down & slept, and so fell into a trance; <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> <normalised orig="laine" auto="true">lain</normalised> <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised> a while, he <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> to quaking & starting <normalised orig="fearefully" auto="true">fearfully</normalised> saying: Dost thou say my <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised> are great▪ <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised>? The Lamb of God hath taken them <normalised orig="awaie" auto="true">away</normalised>: <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> other interrupted speeches he <normalised orig="vttered" auto="true">uttered</normalised>, and slumbered <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>. At length he cried out, Wild horses, wild horses; they <normalised orig="teare" auto="true">tear</normalised> me, they <normalised orig="teare" auto="true">tear</normalised> me; and then was he tormented <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> al the <normalised orig="partes" auto="true">parts</normalised> of his <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>. After that he slept somewhat slumberingly, <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> a most <normalised orig="heauenly" auto="true">heavenly</normalised> and <normalised orig="ioyfull" auto="true">joyful</normalised> vision. When he awaked he looked <normalised orig="cheerefully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised>: and being asked what he saw in these trances, he could not call <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> thing to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>.
This <normalised orig="daie" auto="true">day</normalised> he was cast into <normalised orig="seuen" auto="true">seven</normalised> cruel fits exceeding all he had before: for besides that his mouth was <normalised orig="drawen" auto="true">drawn</normalised> <normalised orig="awrie" auto="true">awry</normalised>, and he in <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> part vexed, his shoulder bones were thrust out of <normalised orig="ioynt" auto="true">joint</normalised>, with other torments most lamentable: thus they ended, for he remained <normalised orig="til" auto="true">till</normalised> xi. a <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> <normalised orig="grieuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> vexed, and almost without intermission. In these his torments, being (for the most part) <normalised orig="senslesse" auto="true">senseless</normalised>, he <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> to <normalised orig="vtter" auto="true">utter</normalised> <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> interrupted speeches, some <normalised orig="fearefull" auto="true">fearful</normalised>, others comfortable; the standers by <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> requested of him, to sing <normalised orig="psalmes" auto="true">psalms</normalised> and pray, be many times had his <normalised orig="eares" auto="true">ears</normalised> shut, and his mouth <normalised orig="stopt" auto="true">stopped</normalised>, so that he could neither <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> nor <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, yet he would <normalised orig="ioine" auto="true">join</normalised> with them in <normalised orig="praier" auto="true">prayer</normalised> and singing so long as he could without interruption. When he was fully <normalised orig="recouered" auto="true">recovered</normalised>, he looked very <normalised orig="cheerefully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised>, <normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> God <normalised orig="thankes" auto="true">thanks</normalised> for his assistance: they asked him many questions concerning his trances, but he could remember nothing that was done. On the nineteenth day of <normalised orig="Maie" auto="true">May</normalised> he fell into trances mixed with torments, in which as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> suffered <normalised orig="grieuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised>, so did he <normalised orig="vtter" auto="true">utter</normalised> many strange speeches, <normalised orig="somtime" auto="true">sometime</normalised> he was so wrested, that no beholder thought it possible for him to <normalised orig="liue" auto="true">live</normalised>; sometime he lay so <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised>, that there scarce appeared any <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of life in him. After he had <normalised orig="laine" auto="true">lain</normalised> a while in a trance he <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>; Mr▪ <normalised orig="Sauiour" auto="true">Saviour</normalised> Christ Iesus was tempted.

and why then should not I bee so? <normalised orig="Pawzing" auto="true">Pausing</normalised> a while <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> said, I <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> a <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> from <normalised orig="heauen" auto="true">heaven</normalised>, the <normalised orig="Lorde" auto="true">Lord</normalised> <normalised orig="speaketh" auto="true">speaks</normalised> to me: and <normalised orig="pawzing" auto="true">pausing</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, he held <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> his <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised> (his <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> being fast closed) and <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, <normalised orig="Looke" auto="true">Look</normalised> where my brother Iob is.

After these speeches, he <normalised orig="clapt" auto="true">clapped</normalised> his <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised>, looking <normalised orig="cheerefully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised>, though his <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> were closed, saying: Christ Iesus my <normalised orig="Sauior" auto="true">Saviour</normalised> <normalised orig="commeth" auto="true">comes</normalised> clothed in purple; then seemed he (by his gestures) to <normalised orig="imbrace" auto="true">embrace</normalised> him, saying: Holy is thy name; thy name (<normalised orig="Lorde" auto="true">Lord</normalised> Iesus) is to be exalted for <normalised orig="euermore" auto="true">evermore</normalised>, I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> such sights, O Lord Iesus <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> me from them. Presently he was <normalised orig="ouertaken" auto="true">overtaken</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> with <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised>, saying: <normalised orig="Doost" auto="true">Dost</normalised> thou say this is the <normalised orig="bottomlesse" auto="true">bottomless</normalised> <normalised orig="pitte" auto="true">pit</normalised> where the damned be? <normalised orig="Maister" auto="true">Master</normalised> Hildersham, we had need to pray, O preach and pray: strait after he looked <normalised orig="cheerefully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised> <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> with admiration, saying: Thy name O <normalised orig="Lorde" auto="true">Lord</normalised> Iesus is to be exalted <normalised orig="aboue" auto="true">above</normalised> all things, thy name is to bee blessed for <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised>. Lying a while in a trance, he clapped his <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised> saying, Oh, oh, Christ Iesus my <normalised orig="sauior" auto="true">saviour</normalised> and his Apostles: Then seemed <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> to embrace the Apostles, and

By and by turning his head, he pointed saying, <normalised orig="Looke" auto="true">Look</normalised> where Iudas is frying in torments. After this he fell <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> into a <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>, and lay as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had bin dead, but spake <normalised orig="fearefully" auto="true">fearfully</normalised> thus; Ah <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> in this place of torments where drunkards are hanged by the throats, swearers and <normalised orig="filthie" auto="true">filthy</normalised> talkers by their tongues: and <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> spoken of other torments for other sins, he <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, O great <normalised orig="iudgements" auto="true">judgements</normalised>, great <normalised orig="iudgements" auto="true">judgements</normalised>, which <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> he <normalised orig="vttered" auto="true">uttered</normalised> so <normalised orig="wofully" auto="true">woefully</normalised>, as if he had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> in the <normalised orig="iawes" auto="true">jaws</normalised> of hell; and on the contrary, so comfortably, as if he had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> in <normalised orig="heauen" auto="true">heaven</normalised>. After this falling into a <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> started <normalised orig="sodainely" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> and <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>, Yonder comes mother <normalised orig="Redde" auto="true">Red</normalised> Cap, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> how they <normalised orig="beate" auto="true">beat</normalised> her <normalised orig="braines" auto="true">brains</normalised> out, see what it is to be a witch: see how the <normalised orig="toades" auto="true">toads</normalised> gnaw the flesh from her bones.

Saunders house at Caldwall being 3. miles distant, where he had <normalised orig="sixe" auto="true">six</normalised> fits. From the 13. to the 23. he was handled after his accustomed <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised>. The 23 of <normalised orig="Maie" auto="true">May</normalised>, he was cast into <normalised orig="eighteene" auto="true">eighteen</normalised> fits worse than the former; for his shoulder bones were thrust out of <normalised orig="ioynt" auto="true">joint</normalised>, his mouth <normalised orig="drawne" auto="true">drawn</normalised> <normalised orig="awrie" auto="true">awry</normalised>; and amongst other complaints, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised>

cried out of his legs, saying they thrust <normalised orig="pinnes" auto="true">pins</normalised> into them. And this is <normalised orig="worthie" auto="true">worthy</normalised> the <normalised orig="obseruation" auto="true">observation</normalised>, that commonly (<normalised orig="vppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the Sabboth) when the boy was <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised> by <normalised orig="praier" auto="true">prayer</normalised> in godly Assemblies, <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> did <normalised orig="shewe" auto="true">show</normalised> his extremest <normalised orig="crueltie" auto="true">cruelty</normalised>. The 24. and 25. he was tormented much like the day before. The 26. he was assaulted more fiercely, both in respect of the number and <normalised orig="qualitie" auto="true">quality</normalised> of his fits & torments, in which he did oftentimes <normalised orig="crie" auto="true">cry</normalised> out, saying; <normalised orig="Looke" auto="true">Look</normalised> where <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised> <normalised orig="commeth" auto="true">comes</normalised> from <normalised orig="vnder" auto="true">under</normalised> the bed: & oftentimes Thunder, thunder; Lightening, lightening; Flames of fire, flames of consuming fire; A <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised>, a <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised>; A dragon, a dragon; <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> where <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised> comes <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> ye chunney, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised>, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised>; for Gods sake take me from him. And thus in these terrible fits this <normalised orig="daye" auto="true">day</normalised> passed. The next <normalised orig="daye" auto="true">day</normalised> there came one Iohn Dorell (a <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> Preacher of the Word) to him; who seeing him in <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> of his fits, assured his <normalised orig="Frends" auto="true">Friends</normalised> and him he was possessed with an <normalised orig="vnclean" auto="true">unclean</normalised> spirit: telling him (out of S. Iames 4 chapt. <normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 7.) that the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> way for his <normalised orig="deliuerance" auto="true">deliverance</normalised> was to resist <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised>; in which if he failed, he <normalised orig="shuld" auto="true">should</normalised> sin against God: because it was a breach of a <normalised orig="Commandement" auto="true">Commandment</normalised>, Resist the <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised>▪ &c. That for his further <normalised orig="incouragement" auto="true">encouragement</normalised>, he had a promise of <normalised orig="victorie" auto="true">victory</normalised>, in that it is said, he will or shall flee; That by the <normalised orig="diuel" auto="true">devil</normalised> is not to be <normalised orig="vnderstood" auto="true">understood</normalised> <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> the temptations of the <normalised orig="diuel" auto="true">devil</normalised>, but <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> <normalised orig="sathans" auto="true">sedans</normalised> <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> person. And proceeding to <normalised orig="confirme" auto="true">confirm</normalised> the Childes faith in this Resistance, he afterwards exhorted his Parents and the whole <normalised orig="Familie" auto="true">Family</normalised> to prepare <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised> against the next day to that holy exercise of Prayer and Fasting; <normalised orig="alledging" auto="true">alleging</normalised> (to put by all doubts) the words of Christ, This <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> <normalised orig="goeth" auto="true">goes</normalised> not out but by <normalised orig="Praier" auto="true">Prayer</normalised> & Fasting. Wheretoo they being <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> willing importuned Iohn Dorell for his presence and assistance. To which he <normalised orig="aunswered" auto="true">answered</normalised>, his <normalised orig="assistaunce" auto="true">assistance</normalised> in <normalised orig="Praier" auto="true">Prayer</normalised> and Fasting they should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised>, but not his presence, as well to <normalised orig="auoide" auto="true">avoid</normalised> note of vaineglorie, as also for he saw no such <normalised orig="necessitie" auto="true">necessity</normalised> by reason of the

Childes strme faith: <normalised orig="neuertheles" auto="true">nevertheless</normalised> <normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> them order for their Exercise, and appointing them the <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> of a <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> called The <normalised orig="Enemie" auto="true">Enemy</normalised> of <normalised orig="Securitie" auto="true">Security</normalised>, & putting them in good comfort, he foretold them what interruptions were likely to follow by the Euemies rage: and (saith he) when you shall see these things come to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> (which <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised> fell out accordingly) then know ye for <normalised orig="certaintie" auto="true">certainty</normalised> as he is possessed (which his <normalised orig="Frendes" auto="true">Friends</normalised> at Cawdwall <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> in doubt of), so <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> that <normalised orig="deliuerance" auto="true">deliverance</normalised> is at the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>; and therefore fame not in the mid-way. Thus he departed. The next day, the Family with some others in the <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> of God being together, the holy Exercise of <normalised orig="Praier" auto="true">Prayer</normalised> and Fasting was taken in hand: and (after some <normalised orig="Praier" auto="true">Prayer</normalised> <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> for the <normalised orig="assistaunce" auto="true">assistance</normalised> of Gods <normalised orig="Spirite" auto="true">Spirit</normalised>, and praying for the remission of <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised>) he was <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="grieuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> and often tormented; & (by <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> of his fits and torments) much interrupted therein, spending much time about the same. A <normalised orig="Praier" auto="true">Prayer</normalised> against the temptations of <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> was <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised>; and in the beginning thereof he was presently taken with a dumb fit: and <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> to <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, he began to pray <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>; and his fits came again and <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> so oft as he came to <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> substantial <normalised orig="Poynt" auto="true">Point</normalised>. After a while he fell into a trance, and at length a small voite came from him saying; Brother Glassap, we cannot <normalised orig="preuaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised>, his faith is so strong, and they fast and pray, and a Preacher <normalised orig="prayeth" auto="true">prays</normalised> as fast as they. After these words, he fell into a fit, and so into a trance, a <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> heard frō him (big & hollow) saying; Brother Radulphus, I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> my master <normalised orig="Belzebub" auto="true">Beelzebub</normalised>, and he shall <normalised orig="dubble" auto="true">double</normalised> their tungs. Then beginning <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to pray, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> fell into a fit, and after into a trance: <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterword</normalised> <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> to himself, he <normalised orig="poynted" auto="true">pointed</normalised> towards the chimney, saying; <normalised orig="Loe" auto="true">Lo</normalised> where <normalised orig="Belzebub" auto="true">Beelzebub</normalised> <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised>, & the witch by him. I charge thee in ye name of the Father the <normalised orig="Sonne" auto="true">Son</normalised> and the Holy Ghost, to tell <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> whether this <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> that did be witch <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> or no? <normalised orig="Doost" auto="true">Dost</normalised> thou say it was <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised>? Now the Lord (I beseech him) <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised>

her, & I <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised> her. Further he said; I charge thee in the name of the Father the <normalised orig="Sonne" auto="true">Son</normalised> and the Holy Ghost to get thee from me, & come no more at me: for it is written, Resist the <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised>, and <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> will <normalised orig="flye" auto="true">fly</normalised> from thee: and presently he <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>; He is gone, he is gone. Then prayed he <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and (at the third word) was <normalised orig="throwne" auto="true">thrown</normalised> into a fit and a <normalised orig="Traunce" auto="true">Trance</normalised>: whērein a <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> was heard from him (<normalised orig="hys" auto="true">his</normalised> mouth being <normalised orig="wyde" auto="true">wide</normalised> op̄en, as still it was when these <normalised orig="voyces" auto="true">voices</normalised> were <normalised orig="vttered" auto="true">uttered</normalised>) saying; Radulphus, <normalised orig="Belzebub" auto="true">Beelzebub</normalised> can doo no good, his head is <normalised orig="stroken" auto="true">stricken</normalised> off with a word: but I <normalised orig="wyll" auto="true">will</normalised> <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> fetch the flying Eagle and his flock. Presently after these words, he fell into another fit and a <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>: and (lying so) <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>; I see an <normalised orig="Angell" auto="true">Angel</normalised> in the <normalised orig="windowe" auto="true">window</normalised>, like a <normalised orig="milke" auto="true">milk</normalised> white <normalised orig="Doue" auto="true">Dove</normalised>, sent from the Lord to bee with <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> to comfort and assist vs: but that is nothing in respect of the Lord <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>.
Then (beginning to pray <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>) he fell into a <normalised orig="Fitte" auto="true">Fit</normalised> and a <normalised orig="Traunce" auto="true">Trance</normalised>: in the which one of the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> <normalised orig="voyces" auto="true">voices</normalised> was heard from him, saying; We cannot <normalised orig="preuayle" auto="true">prevail</normalised>, let vs <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> out of him, and enter into some of these <normalised orig="heere" auto="true">here</normalised>. This <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> came twice, and it made the Standers by <normalised orig="afrayde" auto="true">afraid</normalised>. Then (reading <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>) bee fell into a <normalised orig="Traunce" auto="true">Trance</normalised>: and the former <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> was heard from him, speaking <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> hollowly (as both those <normalised orig="vnnaturall" auto="true">unnatural</normalised> <normalised orig="voyces" auto="true">voices</normalised> not <normalised orig="vttered" auto="true">uttered</normalised> by <normalised orig="hymselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> were) and saying; I would they were all gone but one that is among them: and then wee should doo well <normalised orig="inough" auto="true">enough</normalised>.

Then <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> read <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and (<normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> cast into a <normalised orig="trauce" auto="true">trace</normalised>) one of those <normalised orig="voyces" auto="true">voices</normalised> was heard, saying; There is a Woman earnest at prayer, get her away▪ One in the <normalised orig="Companie" auto="true">Company</normalised> (called Iohn Alsop) <normalised orig="aunswered" auto="true">answered</normalised> <normalised orig="alowd" auto="true">aloud</normalised> and <normalised orig="sayde" auto="true">said</normalised>; Wee cannot spare her: yet did none of them all that were there know that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was praying; till (looking <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>) they saw her earnestly at prayer in a corner being <normalised orig="behynde" auto="true">behind</normalised> them.

Beginning <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to read, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> cast into a <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>, and a <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> was heard which <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>; He shall bee tormented till to <normalised orig="morow" auto="true">morrow</normalised> at night, do God & you what you can: but <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> was <normalised orig="prooued" auto="true">proved</normalised> a liar. <normalised orig="Recouering" auto="true">Recovering</normalised>, & reading <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, he was <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> snatched into his <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>, the <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> heard <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, saying; Wee cannot <normalised orig="preuaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised>, wee cannot <normalised orig="preuaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised>, their Church <normalised orig="increaseth" auto="true">increases</normalised>: at which time came in two to <normalised orig="ioyne" auto="true">join</normalised> in <normalised orig="Praier" auto="true">Prayer</normalised> with yt <normalised orig="Companie" auto="true">Company</normalised>. After this, reading <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, he fell into a <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>, and a <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> was heard from him saying; Here <normalised orig="commeth" auto="true">comes</normalised> one of my people: with that they looked back, and were ware of a man of bad life <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> into the <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised>; and albeit the Boy was in his fit, yet he made <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> with his hand to the <normalised orig="Companie" auto="true">Company</normalised> to get him away; which one of them <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised> did for Presently he awaked and read, and was interrupted by a trance, wherein a <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> said; <normalised orig="Teare" auto="true">Tear</normalised> the <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>, <normalised orig="teare" auto="true">tear</normalised> the <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>: and with that (although his eyes were closed) he snatched at the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> (which one had in his hand) and tare <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> one <normalised orig="leafe" auto="true">leaf</normalised> of it: which thing also from that time till two of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised>, he attempted in <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> of his fits; & being restrained (by reason that one held the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised>, and another his hands) <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would bite strike and <normalised orig="spurne" auto="true">spurn</normalised> them with his <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised> at the beginning of his fits: wherein he was <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> stronger than he was wont, and his torments more exceeding in <normalised orig="greatnes" auto="true">greatness</normalised> & number. <normalised orig="Betweene" auto="true">Between</normalised> 8 in the morning and 2 in the afternoon his countenance was strangely disfigured, his mouth set wide open, & sometime <normalised orig="drawne" auto="true">drawn</normalised> <normalised orig="awrie" auto="true">awry</normalised>, his face turned backward, and his <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> and sholders thrust out of <normalised orig="ioynt" auto="true">joint</normalised>: in which time he had one <normalised orig="fitt" auto="true">fit</normalised> and trance, wherein a <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>; Wee cannot <normalised orig="preuaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised>, for they will not be <normalised orig="holpen" auto="true">helped</normalised> with Witches. Brother Radulphus we cannot <normalised orig="preuaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised>: let vs <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to our <normalised orig="mistres" auto="true">mistress</normalised> and torment her, I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> had a draught of her blood to day, Forthwith it ceased, and straight <normalised orig="waies" auto="true">ways</normalised> he was in a trance <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and a small <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> was heard, saying; I will stop


thy <normalised orig="mouthe" auto="true">mouth</normalised> I will stop thy mouth: at which <normalised orig="instaut" auto="true">instate</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was so stopped in his <normalised orig="throate" auto="true">throat</normalised>, that the <normalised orig="Companie" auto="true">Company</normalised> thought he had been strangled. In another fit, a <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> said; Your <normalised orig="praiers" auto="true">prayers</normalised> <normalised orig="preuaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised> not, they are not heard. <normalised orig="Wherunto" auto="true">Whereunto</normalised> M. Rampam (Schoolmaster of Burton) replied; Thou art a liar <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised>, for it is written: <normalised orig="Wheresoeuer" auto="true">Wheresoever</normalised> two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the <normalised orig="middest" auto="true">midst</normalised> of them, &c. About two of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had a <normalised orig="meruailous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> strange fit, tormenting him most <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised>: in the <normalised orig="ende" auto="true">end</normalised> whereof he strained to cast with great <normalised orig="vehemencie" auto="true">vehemence</normalised>, and got <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> some <normalised orig="fleame" auto="true">fleam</normalised> and <normalised orig="choller" auto="true">choler</normalised>; at which time, if he were possessed with two <normalised orig="spirites" auto="true">spirits</normalised>, (as it is probable he was) one of them went out of him. So from 2. till 4. his fits continued but decreasing in strength, and <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> without speeches. About 3. the <normalised orig="Companie" auto="true">Company</normalised> <normalised orig="perceiuing" auto="true">perceiving</normalised> him to bee faint, <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> him to <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> somewhat to refresh him: which he did (<normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> touched neither <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> nor <normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised> of all the whole day before): but before & after his <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> he said the Lords <normalised orig="Praier" auto="true">Prayer</normalised>, and other Praiets in the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> (which <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> before had <normalised orig="assaied" auto="true">assayed</normalised> to read and could not) without <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> interruption. About 6, a <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> (being carried on his Keepers back, for he had no <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of his legs of three months before) his fit came <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> him <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised>, & he cried out like a <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised>. The standers by <normalised orig="betooke" auto="true">betook</normalised> <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised> to <normalised orig="Praier" auto="true">Prayer</normalised>. During this fit <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had <normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> miserable torments, causing him to <normalised orig="roare" auto="true">roar</normalised> and shrike <normalised orig="extreamly" auto="true">extremely</normalised>. Many such <normalised orig="senslesse" auto="true">senseless</normalised> trances on this <normalised orig="daye" auto="true">day</normalised> of his <normalised orig="deliueraunce" auto="true">deliverance</normalised> he had, as <normalised orig="yeelded" auto="true">yielded</normalised> no <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of life, <normalised orig="saue" auto="true">save</normalised> that his heart might be discerned to pant a little. At last (being laid <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his bed) <normalised orig="anone" auto="true">anon</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> began to <normalised orig="heaue" auto="true">heave</normalised> and lift vehemently at his <normalised orig="stomacke" auto="true">stomach</normalised>, and getting <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> some <normalised orig="fleame" auto="true">fleam</normalised> and <normalised orig="choller" auto="true">choler</normalised>, (<normalised orig="poynting" auto="true">pointing</normalised> with his finger and following with his eyes) <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> said; <normalised orig="Looke" auto="true">Look</normalised>, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised>, see you not the Mouse that is gone out of my mouth: and so <normalised orig="poynted" auto="true">pointed</normalised> after it <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> the furthest part of the <normalised orig="parlor" auto="true">parlour</normalised>. Then <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> fell into a quiet trance; which ended, he was well till 7. a <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised>: at
which time he and 2. or 3. more went to supper: and as he sate at the table he fell into a trance, and was thence <normalised orig="caried" auto="true">carried</normalised> to bed; as he lay there, a <normalised orig="Uoice" auto="true">Voice</normalised> was heard, saying; My Son arise <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> and <normalised orig="walke" auto="true">walk</normalised>, the <normalised orig="euill" auto="true">evil</normalised> spirit is gone from thee; arise and <normalised orig="walke" auto="true">walk</normalised>. Upon this accident his Keeper said; let vs see if he can <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> betwixt vs. But he answered no; I can <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> of my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>. I <normalised orig="thanke" auto="true">thank</normalised> God: and so (standing on his <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised>) went presently forward without <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> <normalised orig="difficultie" auto="true">difficulty</normalised>. And considering with <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> this blessed change of his miserable estate, (of his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> accord) he fell flat <normalised orig="vppon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the ground, <normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> God <normalised orig="thankes" auto="true">thanks</normalised> for his <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> <normalised orig="deliueraunce" auto="true">deliverance</normalised>; and that in such excellent manner, as was to bee admired in a <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>. But no doubt, the same <normalised orig="Spirite" auto="true">Spirit</normalised> which armed <normalised orig="hym" auto="true">him</normalised> with faith and patience in the time of his torments, instructed him how to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <normalised orig="thankes" auto="true">thanks</normalised> and pray. Being thus fully <normalised orig="recouered" auto="true">recovered</normalised>, he went presently into the <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised>, that it might <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> what Iesus had done for him, to the praise of his <normalised orig="glorie" auto="true">glory</normalised>, and admitation of those that had, been acquainted with his <normalised orig="meruailous" auto="true">marvelous</normalised> visitation.
The next morning Robert Toone went to the <normalised orig="Gaole" auto="true">Gaol</normalised>, and demanded of the Witch how she did? O master quoth she, <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> worse i for I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> had such an Ague this night, that I had thought my <normalised orig="ioints" auto="true">joints</normalised> would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> been torn in sunder. They that dwelt by the prison, could▪ not <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised> for the <normalised orig="noyse" auto="true">noise</normalised> that was there that night; so that it is like the <normalised orig="diuell" auto="true">devil</normalised> was as good as his word, when he said he would torment her.

After he was thus <normalised orig="meruailously" auto="true">marvelously</normalised> <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised>, he <normalised orig="stayd" auto="true">stayed</normalised> the next day at Cawdwall, & from thence went to his grandfathers M. Walkedens at Clifton; whether the aforesaid Iohn Dorell repaired <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> him, and counselled him to be now most <normalised orig="heedfull" auto="true">heedful</normalised>, least the <normalised orig="vncleane" auto="true">unclean</normalised> spirit returning, and his heart <normalised orig="emptie" auto="true">empty</normalised> of faith, bring 7 worse than himself with him, as our <normalised orig="Sauior" auto="true">Saviour</normalised> <normalised orig="expresseth" auto="true">expresses</normalised>; assuring <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> would <normalised orig="striue" auto="true">strive</normalised> to <normalised orig="repossesse" auto="true">repossess</normalised> him.

Iohn Dorell departing, the Boy abode at Clifton till the 5. of <normalised orig="Iune" auto="true">June</normalised>, which day he returned to Burton. There the 6. day (<normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> the <normalised orig="Sabaoth" auto="true">Sabbath</normalised>) and the 7. <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> spent in religious excrecise. The 8 the went to <normalised orig="Schoole" auto="true">School</normalised>, from whence <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised> had long kept him. In the <normalised orig="afternoone" auto="true">afternoon</normalised> sitting at his book, he said <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> his <normalised orig="fellowes" auto="true">fellows</normalised>; if you will <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> with me into the Church-yard, I will show you a strange thing. <normalised orig="Wherevpon" auto="true">Whereupon</normalised> they went into the <normalised orig="Schoole" auto="true">School</normalised> Porch, (which their Master disliked not, because they had their <normalised orig="Bookes" auto="true">Books</normalised> in <normalised orig="theyr" auto="true">their</normalised> hands) where after he had walked a while, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> sate <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> and said he was <normalised orig="wearie" auto="true">weary</normalised>, and presently complained of one of his legs▪ <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> crying out: which his Master hearing, came to him; and <normalised orig="remembring" auto="true">remembering</normalised> his former <normalised orig="trialls" auto="true">trials</normalised>, prayed, <normalised orig="moouing" auto="true">moving</normalised> the <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> to say after him, O Lord for Iesus <normalised orig="Christes" auto="true">Christ's</normalised> sake <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="mercie" auto="true">mercy</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> me. But he most cried, O my legs, my legs. Here is to bee noted, that how <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised> <normalised orig="greeuously" auto="true">grievously</normalised> assaulted him, yet did he not once torment him, because he was not (as before) in him which also some of the <normalised orig="Boyes" auto="true">Boys</normalised> words confirmed.
Being brought home to his Uncles, (<normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> following and flocking after him) <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> groaned <normalised orig="pittifully" auto="true">pitifully</normalised>, crying also, Daggers, daggers: and at length he said (with a <normalised orig="fearfull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> countenance) I am afraid of <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised>. The <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> did <normalised orig="incourage" auto="true">encourage</normalised> and comfort him against such temptations, <normalised orig="perswading" auto="true">persuading</normalised> him to prayer; which thing he <normalised orig="perfourmed" auto="true">performed</normalised> <normalised orig="wyth" auto="true">with</normalised> great <normalised orig="difficultie" auto="true">difficulty</normalised>, crying as before O my legs, O my legs. They being instant <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> him to pray, he <normalised orig="poynted" auto="true">pointed</normalised> with his finger saying; What woman is that which <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> there: Still they <normalised orig="vrged" auto="true">urged</normalised> him with <normalised orig="praier" auto="true">prayer</normalised>: and while they expected it▪ he said; what a <normalised orig="thundring" auto="true">thundering</normalised> is here? I cannot abide this <normalised orig="thundring" auto="true">thundering</normalised>. Then fell he into a trance, and <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> <normalised orig="layne" auto="true">lain</normalised> a while, a <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> was heard from him saying; He <normalised orig="fel" auto="true">fell</normalised> a little and I caught him. By and by awaking <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> rose <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> amazedly and said; Where am I▪ I was <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> now in the <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised>? but they told him what had happened, so he came

down from his bed; and feeling <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> well, he prayed & read a chapter quietly, and so remained well all that night. The next morning the <normalised orig="Boyes" auto="true">Boys</normalised> Uncle thought it <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <normalised orig="conuenient" auto="true">convenient</normalised> to <normalised orig="labor" auto="true">labour</normalised> by <normalised orig="Praier" auto="true">Prayer</normalised> to <normalised orig="remooue" auto="true">remove</normalised> this <normalised orig="heauie" auto="true">heavy</normalised> displeasure of God, and the danger of these temptations, wherewith the Boy began agains to be assaulted: & to that end sent for two of his <normalised orig="neighbors" auto="true">neighbours</normalised>, & spent an <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> in <normalised orig="praier" auto="true">prayer</normalised> & reading the Scriptures. At last as the Boy was reading, be <normalised orig="stopt" auto="true">stopped</normalised>, saying; what woman is that which stands there▪ They <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> him to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> on, and not regard the illusions of <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised>. So he read on, and was presently cast into a trance: and after he had <normalised orig="laine" auto="true">lain</normalised> a while said; Behold I see a <normalised orig="Lambe" auto="true">Lamb</normalised>, <normalised orig="hearke" auto="true">hark</normalised> what the <normalised orig="Lambe" auto="true">Lamb</normalised> saith; Thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> fall & he caught thee: <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> not, the Lord is thy buckler and defender. After this <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> read on, and within a little space fell <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> into a quiet <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>, saying; Dost thou say if I <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> worship thee, thou wilt make me <normalised orig="vnderstand" auto="true">understand</normalised> the secrets of all <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> hearts?

Then did he read <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and <normalised orig="foorthwith" auto="true">forthwith</normalised> was cast into a <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>, saying; What <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> woman is this, that is so gorgeously <normalised orig="apparailed" auto="true">apparelled</normalised>?

I <normalised orig="wyll" auto="true">will</normalised> not. He read <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, <normalised orig="aud" auto="true">and</normalised> at the third word was snatched into his trance, saying; <normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> thou <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> me a bag full of gold and <normalised orig="siluer" auto="true">silver</normalised>, if I will <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> read nor pray <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> God <normalised orig="anie" auto="true">any</normalised> more? <normalised orig="Auoyd" auto="true">Avoid</normalised> <normalised orig="sathan" auto="true">satan</normalised>, I neither regard thy gold nor <normalised orig="siluer" auto="true">silver</normalised>; the Lord and his Word is better to <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> than all the gold and <normalised orig="siluer" auto="true">silver</normalised> in the world.

They offered him the <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, and he <normalised orig="falles" auto="true">falls</normalised> presently into a <normalised orig="traunce" auto="true">trance</normalised>, saying; <normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> thou <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> <normalised orig="teare" auto="true">tear</normalised> the <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>?
