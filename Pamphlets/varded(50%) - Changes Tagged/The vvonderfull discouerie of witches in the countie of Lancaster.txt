Therefore I pray you <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> me <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised>, (with your patience and <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised>,) before I proceed to the Indictment, <normalised orig="Arraignement" auto="true">Arraignment</normalised>, and <normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised> of such as were Prisoners in the Castle, to lay open the life and death of this damnable and malicious Witch, of so long continuance (old Demdike) of whom our whole <normalised orig="businesse" auto="true">business</normalised> hath such dependence, that without the particular Declaration and Record of her <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised>, with the <normalised orig="circumstaunces" auto="true">circumstances</normalised>, wee shall <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> bring any thing to good perfection: for from this <normalised orig="Sincke" auto="true">Sink</normalised> of <normalised orig="villanie" auto="true">villainy</normalised> and <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised>, <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> all the rest proceeded; as you shall <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> them in order.

She was a very old woman, about the age of Foure-score <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, and had been a Witch for <normalised orig="fiftie" auto="true">fifty</normalised> <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>. <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> dwelt in the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle, a <normalised orig="vaste" auto="true">vast</normalised> place, <normalised orig="fitte" auto="true">fit</normalised> for her profession: What <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> committed in her time, no man <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised>.

But God, who had in his <normalised orig="diuine" auto="true">divine</normalised> <normalised orig="prouidence" auto="true">providence</normalised> <normalised orig="prouided" auto="true">provided</normalised> to cut them off, and <normalised orig="roote" auto="true">root</normalised> them out of the Commonwealth, so disposed <normalised orig="aboue" auto="true">above</normalised>, that the <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of those <normalised orig="partes" auto="true">parts</normalised>, <normalised orig="vnderstanding" auto="true">understanding</normalised> by a <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> <normalised orig="charme" auto="true">charm</normalised> and muttering, the great and <normalised orig="vniuersall" auto="true">universal</normalised> resort to Maulking Tower, the common opinion, with the report of these suspected people, the complaint of the <normalised orig="Kinges" auto="true">Kings</normalised> <normalised orig="subiectes" auto="true">subjects</normalised> for the <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> of their Children, <normalised orig="Friendes" auto="true">Friends</normalised>, <normalised orig="Goodes" auto="true">Goods</normalised>, and Cattle, (as there could not be so great Fire without some <normalised orig="Smoake" auto="true">Smoke</normalised>,) sent for some of the <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised>, and <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> great <normalised orig="paynes" auto="true">pains</normalised> to enquire after their <normalised orig="proceedinges" auto="true">proceedings</normalised>, and courses of life.

But <normalised orig="heere" auto="true">here</normalised> they had not stayed a <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, when their Children and <normalised orig="Friendes" auto="true">Friends</normalised> being abroad at <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised>, laboured a <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> meeting at <normalised orig="Malking" auto="true">Milking</normalised> Tower in the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle, <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Good-fryday, within a <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> after they were, committed, of all the most dangerous, wicked, and damnable Witches in the County <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> and <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised>. <normalised orig="Vpon" auto="true">Upon</normalised> Good-fryday they met, according to <normalised orig="solemne" auto="true">solemn</normalised> <normalised orig="appoyntment" auto="true">appointment</normalised>, <normalised orig="solemnized" auto="true">solemnised</normalised> this great <normalised orig="Feastiuall" auto="true">Festival</normalised> day according to their former order, with great <normalised orig="cheare" auto="true">cheer</normalised>, merry-company, and much conference.

<normalised orig="VPon" auto="true">Upon</normalised> the Tewesday in the after <normalised orig="noone" auto="true">noon</normalised>, the <normalised orig="Iudges" auto="true">Judges</normalised> according to the course and order, <normalised orig="deuided" auto="true">divided</normalised> them <normalised orig="selues" auto="true">selves</normalised>, <normalised orig="wherevpon" auto="true">whereupon</normalised> my Lord Bromley, one of his Maiestices <normalised orig="Iudges" auto="true">Judges</normalised> of Assise <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> into the Hall to <normalised orig="proceede" auto="true">proceed</normalised> with the Pleaes of the <normalised orig="Crowne" auto="true">Crown</normalised>, & the <normalised orig="Arraignement" auto="true">Arraignment</normalised> and <normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised> of Prisoners, <normalised orig="commaunded" auto="true">commanded</normalised> a <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> Proclamation, that all <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Peace that had taken any Recognisaunces, or Examinations of Prisoners, should make <normalised orig="Returne" auto="true">Return</normalised> of them: And all such as were bound to prosecute <normalised orig="Indictmentes" auto="true">Indictments</normalised>, and <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> against Witches, should <normalised orig="proceede" auto="true">proceed</normalised>, and <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> attendance: For <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> now intended to proceed to the <normalised orig="Arraignement" auto="true">Arraignment</normalised> and <normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised> of VVitches.

After which, the Court being set, M.

But <normalised orig="heere" auto="true">here</normalised> we want old Demdike, who dyed in the Castle before she came to her <normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>.





<normalised orig="Heere" auto="true">Here</normalised> you may not expect the exact order of the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised>, with the Proclamations, and other solemnities belonging to so great a Court of <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised>??? but the <normalised orig="proceedinges" auto="true">proceedings</normalised> against the Witches, who are now <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> their <normalised orig="deliuerance" auto="true">deliverance</normalised> here in order as they came to the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>, with the particular <normalised orig="poyntes" auto="true">points</normalised> of <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> against them: which is the labour and <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> we now intend (by Gods grace) to <normalised orig="performe" auto="true">perform</normalised> as we may, to your <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> contentment.
<normalised orig="Wherevpon" auto="true">Whereupon</normalised>, the first of all these, Anne Whittle, alias Chattox, was brought to the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>: against whom wee are now ready to proceed.

 



The <normalised orig="Arraignement" auto="true">Arraignment</normalised> and <normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised> of Anne Whittle, alias Chattox, of the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, <normalised orig="Widdow" auto="true">Widow</normalised>; about the age of <normalised orig="Fourescore" auto="true">Fourscore</normalised> <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, or <normalised orig="thereaboutes" auto="true">thereabouts</normalised>.

Anne Whittle, alias Chattox.
IF in this damnable course of life, and offences, more horrible and odious, then any man is able to <normalised orig="expresse" auto="true">express</normalised>: any man <normalised orig="lyuing" auto="true">living</normalised> could lament the estate of any such like <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> earth: The example of this <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> creature, would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="moued" auto="true">moved</normalised> <normalised orig="pittie" auto="true">pity</normalised>, in respect of her great contrition and repentance, after she was committed to the Castle at Lancaster, <normalised orig="vntill" auto="true">until</normalised> the <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iudges" auto="true">Judges</normalised> of Assise. But such was the nature of her offences, & the multitude of her crying <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised>, as it <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> away all sense of humanity. And the repetition of her hellish practises, and <normalised orig="Reuenge" auto="true">Revenge</normalised>; being the chiefest <normalised orig="thinges" auto="true">things</normalised> wherein she <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> great delight, <normalised orig="togeather" auto="true">together</normalised> with a particular declaration of the Murders <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had committed, <normalised orig="layde" auto="true">laid</normalised> open to the world, and <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> in <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> against her at the time of her <normalised orig="Arraignement" auto="true">Arraignment</normalised> and



<normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>; as <normalised orig="certainely" auto="true">certainly</normalised> it did beget contempt in the Audience, and such as she <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> offended.
This Anne Whittle, alias Chattox, was a very old withered spent & <normalised orig="decreped" auto="true">decrepit</normalised> creature, her sight almost gone: A dangerous Witch, of very long continuance; <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> opposite to old Demdike: For whom the one <normalised orig="fauoured" auto="true">favoured</normalised>,[2] the other hated deadly: and how they <normalised orig="enuie" auto="true">envy</normalised> and accuse one an other, in their Examinations, may <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised>.

In her Witchcraft, <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> more ready to doe <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised> to <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> goods, then <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised>. Her <normalised orig="lippes" auto="true">lips</normalised> <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> chattering and walking: but no man knew what. She <normalised orig="liued" auto="true">lived</normalised> in the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle, amongst this wicked company of dangerous Witches. Yet in her Examination and Confession, she dealt <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> very <normalised orig="plainely" auto="true">plainly</normalised> and <normalised orig="truely" auto="true">truly</normalised>: for <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> a <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> occasion being oftentimes examined in open Court, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> found to vary, but <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> to agree in one, and the <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> same thing.

I place her in order, next to that wicked fire-brand of <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised>, old Demdike, because from these two, sprung all the rest in order: and were the Children and <normalised orig="Friendes" auto="true">Friends</normalised>, of these two notorious VVitches.

Many <normalised orig="thinges" auto="true">things</normalised> in the discovery of them, shall be very worthy your <normalised orig="obseruation" auto="true">observation</normalised>. As the times and occasions to execute their <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised>. And this in <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised>: the Spirit could <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> hurt, till they <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> consent.

And, but that it is my charge, to set <normalised orig="foorth" auto="true">forth</normalised> a particular Declaration of the <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> against them, <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> their <normalised orig="Arraignement" auto="true">Arraignment</normalised> and <normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>; with their <normalised orig="Diuelish" auto="true">Devilish</normalised> practises, consultations, meetings, and murders committed by them,

 


in such sort, as they were <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> in <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> against them??? for the which, I shall <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> matter <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Record. I could make a large Comentarie of them: But it is my humble <normalised orig="duety" auto="true">duty</normalised>, to <normalised orig="obserue" auto="true">observe</normalised> the Charge and <normalised orig="Commaundement" auto="true">Commandment</normalised> of these my <normalised orig="Honorable" auto="true">Honourable</normalised> good <normalised orig="Lordes" auto="true">Lords</normalised> the <normalised orig="Iudges" auto="true">Judges</normalised> of Assise, and not to exceed the limits of my Commission. Wherefore I shall now bring this <normalised orig="auncient" auto="true">ancient</normalised> Witch, to the due course of her <normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, in order. viz.

Indictment.

THe said <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised>, being a <normalised orig="yong" auto="true">young</normalised> <normalised orig="Maide" auto="true">Maid</normalised>, about the age of nine <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, and commanded to stand <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> against her Mother, Prisoner at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>: Her Mother, according to her accustomed manner, <normalised orig="outragiously" auto="true">outrageously</normalised> cursing, <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> out against the child in such <normalised orig="fearefull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> manner, as all the Court did not a little wonder at her, and so amazed the child, as with weeping <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised>



<normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> out <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> my Lord the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised>, and told him, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was not able to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> in the presence of her Mother.
This odious Witch was branded with a preposterous <normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised> in Nature, <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> from her birth, which was her left eye, standing lower then the other; the one looking <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, the other looking <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised>, so strangely deformed, as the best that were present in that <normalised orig="Honorable" auto="true">Honourable</normalised> Assembly, and great Audience, did <normalised orig="affirme" auto="true">affirm</normalised>, they had not often <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> the like.

No <normalised orig="intreatie" auto="true">entreaty</normalised>, promise of <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised>, or other respect, could put her to silence, thinking by this her <normalised orig="outragious" auto="true">outrageous</normalised> cursing and <normalised orig="threatning" auto="true">threatening</normalised> of the child, to <normalised orig="inforce" auto="true">enforce</normalised> her to <normalised orig="denie" auto="true">deny</normalised> that which she had formerly confessed against her Mother, before M. <normalised orig="Nowel" auto="true">Novel</normalised>: Forswearing and denying her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="voluntarie" auto="true">voluntary</normalised> confession, which you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> heard, <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> in <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> against her at large, and so for want of further <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> to escape that, which the <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised> of the Law had <normalised orig="prouided" auto="true">provided</normalised> as a <normalised orig="condigne" auto="true">condign</normalised> punishment for the innocent <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had spilt, and her wicked and <normalised orig="deuillish" auto="true">devilish</normalised> course of life.

In the end, when no <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> would <normalised orig="serue" auto="true">serve</normalised>, his Lordship commanded the Prisoner to be taken away, and the <normalised orig="Maide" auto="true">Maid</normalised> to bee set <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the Table in the presence of the whole Court, who <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> her <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> in that <normalised orig="Honorable" auto="true">Honourable</normalised> assembly, to the Gentlemen of the <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> of life and death, as <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>. viz.

And further, this Examinate <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, that about a <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> after, this Examinates Mother called for the said Ball, who appeared as aforesaid, asking this Examinates Mother what <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> done, who said, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> him to kill Iames Robinson, alias Swyer, of Barlow aforesaid, Brother to the said Iohn: whereunto Ball answered, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would doe it; and about three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> after, the said Iames dyed.
And this Examinate also saith, that one other time <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was present, when her said Mother did call for the said Ball,[3] who appeared in manner as aforesaid, and asked this Examinates Mother what <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> him to doe, whereunto this Examinates Mother then said <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> him to kill one <normalised orig="Mitton" auto="true">Mitten</normalised> of the Rough-Lee, whereupon the said Ball said, he would doe it, and so vanished away, and about three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised> after, the said <normalised orig="Mitton" auto="true">Mitten</normalised> likewise dyed.

The reason wherefore he was so killed, was for that this Examinates said Grand-mother Old Demdike, had asked the said <normalised orig="Mitton" auto="true">Mitten</normalised> a penny; and he denying her thereof, thereupon she procured his death, as aforesaid.

And he, this Examinate also saith, That about three <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> ago, this Examinate being in his Grand-mothers house, with his said mother; there came a thing in shape of a browne <normalised orig="dogge" auto="true">dog</normalised>, which his mother called Ball, who spake to this Examinates mother, in the sight and hearing of this Examinates, and bad her make a Picture of Clay like <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> Iohn Robinson, alias Swyer, and <normalised orig="drie" auto="true">dry</normalised> it hard, and then crumble it by little and little; and as the said Picture should crumble or mull away, so should the said Io. Robinson alias Swyer his body decay and <normalised orig="weare" auto="true">wear</normalised> away. And within two or three <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> after, the Picture shall so all be wasted, and mulled away; so then the said Iohn Robinson should die presently. <normalised orig="Vpon" auto="true">Upon</normalised> the agreement betwixt

 


the said <normalised orig="dogge" auto="true">dog</normalised> and this Examinates mother; the said <normalised orig="dogge" auto="true">dog</normalised> suddenly vanished out of this Examinates sight.

But because I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> charged her to be the <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> Agent, to procure a <normalised orig="solemne" auto="true">solemn</normalised> meeting at Malking-Tower of the Grand-witches, to consult of some speedy course for the <normalised orig="deliuerance" auto="true">deliverance</normalised> of her mother, Old Demdike, her daughter, and other Witches at Lancaster: the <normalised orig="speedie" auto="true">speedy</normalised> Execution of Master Couell, who little suspected or <normalised orig="deserued" auto="true">deserved</normalised> any such practise or <normalised orig="villany" auto="true">villainy</normalised> against him: The blowing <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> of the Castle, with <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> other wicked and <normalised orig="diuellish" auto="true">devilish</normalised> practises and <normalised orig="murthers" auto="true">murders</normalised>; I shall make it <normalised orig="apparant" auto="true">apparent</normalised> <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> you, by the particular Examinations and <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> of her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> children, such as were present at the time of their Consultation, together with her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> Examination and Confession, amongst the Records of the <normalised orig="Crowne" auto="true">Crown</normalised> at the Lancaster, as hereafter <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>.

This Iames <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle, being brought to the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>, was there according to the <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised>, order, and course, Indicted and Arraigned; for that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="Felloniously" auto="true">Feloniously</normalised> had practised, <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised>, and exercised <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> wicked and <normalised orig="deuillish" auto="true">devilish</normalised> Arts, called Witch-crafts, <normalised orig="Inchauntments" auto="true">Enchantments</normalised>, <normalised orig="Charmes" auto="true">Charms</normalised>, and Sorceries, in, and <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> one Anne Towneley, wife of Henrie Towneley of the Carre, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster Gentleman, and her by force of the same, <normalised orig="felloniously" auto="true">feloniously</normalised> had killed. <normalised orig="Contra" auto="true">Country</normalised> pacem, &c.

The Examination of IAMES DEVICE, <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> of ELIZABETH DEVICE, of the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, Labourer. Taken the <normalised orig="seuen" auto="true">seven</normalised> and twentieth day of <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised>, Anno{que}, Reg.

HE saith, that <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> <normalised orig="Sheare" auto="true">Shear</normalised> Thursday was two <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, his Grand-Mother Elizabeth Sothernes, alias Dembdike, did bid him this Examinate <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to the church to <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> the Communion (the next day after being Good Friday) and then not to <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> the Bread the Minister <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> him, but to bring it and <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> it to such a thing as should meet him in his way homewards: Notwithstanding her <normalised orig="perswasions" auto="true">persuasions</normalised>, this Examinate did <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> the Bread: and so in his <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised>, homeward some <normalised orig="fortie" auto="true">forty</normalised> <normalised orig="roodes" auto="true">roods</normalised> off the said Church, there met him a thing in the shape of a Hare, who spoke <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> this Examinate, and asked him whether <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had brought the Bread that his Grand-mother had bidden him, or no? whereupon this Examinate answered, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had not: and thereupon the said thing <normalised orig="threatned" auto="true">threatened</normalised> to pull this Examinate in <normalised orig="peeces" auto="true">pieces</normalised>, and so this Examinate thereupon marked <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> to God, and so the said thing vanished out of this Examinates sight. And within some <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> after that, there appeared in this Examinates sight, hard by the new Church in Pendle, a thing like <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> a browne

 


<normalised orig="Dogge" auto="true">Dog</normalised>, who asked this Examinate to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> him his <normalised orig="Soule" auto="true">Soul</normalised>, and he should be <normalised orig="reuenged" auto="true">revenged</normalised> of any whom <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would: whereunto this Examinate answered, that his <normalised orig="Soule" auto="true">Soul</normalised> was not his to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised>, but was his <normalised orig="Sauiour" auto="true">Saviour</normalised> Iesus Christs, but as much as was in him this Examinate to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised>, he was contented he should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> it.
And within two or three <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> after, this Examinate went to the Carre-Hall, and <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> some speeches betwixt <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Towneley and this Examinate; <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> charging this Examinate and his said mother, to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="stolne" auto="true">stolen</normalised> some Turues of hers, <normalised orig="badde" auto="true">bad</normalised> him <normalised orig="packe" auto="true">pack</normalised> the <normalised orig="doores" auto="true">doors</normalised>: and <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised> as he went forth of the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>, the said <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Towneley <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> him a knock <normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised> the shoulders: and about a day or two after that, there appeared <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> this Examinate in his way, a thing like <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> a black dog, who put this Examinate in <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> of the said <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Towneleyes falling out with him this Examinate; who bad this Examinate make a Picture of Clay, like <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> the said <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Towneley: and that this Examinate with the <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> of his Spirit (who then <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> after <normalised orig="bidde" auto="true">bid</normalised> this Examinate to call it Dandy) would kill or destroy the said <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Towneley: and so the said <normalised orig="dogge" auto="true">dog</normalised> vanished out of this Examinates sight. And the next morning after, this Examinate <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> Clay, and made a Picture of the said <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Towneley, and dried it the same night by the fire: and within a day after, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised>, this Examinate began to crumble the said Picture, <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> day some, for the space of a <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>: and within two <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> after all was crumbled away; the said <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Towneley died.

And <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> further saith, That in Lent last one Iohn Duckworth of the Lawnde, promised this Examinate an old shirt: and within a fortnight after, this Examinate



went to the said Duckworthes house, and demanded the said old shirt; but the said Duckworth denied him thereof. And going out of the said house, the said Spirit Dandy appeared <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> this Examinate, and said, Thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> touch the said Duckworth; whereunto this Examinate answered, he did not touch him: yes (said the Spirit <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>) thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> touch him, and <normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised> I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> power of him: whereupon this Examinate <normalised orig="ioyned" auto="true">joined</normalised> with the said Spirit, and then wished the said Spirit to kill the said Duckworth: and within one <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised>, then next after, Duckworth died.
This voluntary Confession and Examination of his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised>, containing in <normalised orig="itselfe" auto="true">itself</normalised> matter sufficient in Law to charge him, and to <normalised orig="proue" auto="true">prove</normalised> his offences, contained in the two <normalised orig="seuerall" auto="true">several</normalised> Indictments, was sufficient to <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> the Gentlemen of the <normalised orig="Iury" auto="true">Jury</normalised> of Life and Death, that he is <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> of them, and either of them: yet my Lord Bromley commanded, for their better satisfaction, that the Witnesses present in Court against any of the Prisoners, should be examined openly, <normalised orig="viua" auto="true">viva</normalised> voce, that the Prisoner might both <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> and <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> to <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> particular point of their <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised>; notwithstanding any of their Examinations taken before any of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Peace within the same <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised>.

BEing examined in open Court, she saith, That her brother Iames <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised>, the Prisoner at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>, hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a Witch for the space of three <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>: about the beginning of which time, there appeared <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> him, in this Examinates mothers house, a Black-Dogge, which her said brother called Dandy.[5] And further, this Examinate <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, & saith: That her said brother about a <normalised orig="twelue" auto="true">twelve</normalised> month since, in the presence of this Examinate, and in the house aforesaid, called for the said Dandy, who thereupon appeared; asking this Examinates brother what he would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> him to doe. This Examinates brother then said, he would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> him to <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> him to kill old <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Towneley of the Carre: whereunto the said Dandy answered, and said, That her said brother should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> his best <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> for the doing of the same; and that her said brother, and the said Dandy, did both in this Examinates hearing, say, they would make away the said <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Towneley. And about a <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> after, this Examinate <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> to the Carre-Hall, saw the said <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Towneley in the <normalised orig="Kitchin" auto="true">Kitchen</normalised> there, nothing well: whereupon it came into this Examinates <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>, that her said brother, by the help of Dandy, had brought the said <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Towneley into the state she then was in.





Which Examinat, although she were but very <normalised orig="yong" auto="true">young</normalised>, yet it was <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> to the Court, in so great a Presence and Audience, with what <normalised orig="modestie" auto="true">modesty</normalised>, <normalised orig="gouernement" auto="true">government</normalised>, and <normalised orig="vnderstanding" auto="true">understanding</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> this <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> against the Prisoner at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>, being her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised> brother, which he <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> could not deny, but there acknowledged in <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> particular to be <normalised orig="iust" auto="true">just</normalised> and true.
But behold a little further, for here this <normalised orig="bloudy" auto="true">bloody</normalised> Monster did not stay his hands: for besides his wicked and <normalised orig="diuellish" auto="true">devilish</normalised> <normalised orig="Spels" auto="true">Spells</normalised>, practises, meetings to consult of murder and <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised>, which (by Gods grace) hereafter shall follow in order against him; there is yet more <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> to be laid <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> his charge. For although he were but <normalised orig="yong" auto="true">young</normalised>, and in the beginning of his Time, yet was he <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> to <normalised orig="obserue" auto="true">observe</normalised> his Instructions from Old Demdike his Grandmother, and Elizabeth <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised> his mother, in so much that no time should <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> since his first entrance into that damnable <normalised orig="Arte" auto="true">Art</normalised> and exercise of Witchcrafts, <normalised orig="Inchantments" auto="true">Enchantments</normalised>, <normalised orig="Charmes" auto="true">Charms</normalised> and Sorceries, without <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised> or murder.

And at another time this Examinate <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised> and saith, That her said brother did call the said Dandy: who thereupon appeared in the said house, asking this Examinates brother what <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> him to doe: whereupon this Examinates said brother said, he would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> him to kill Blaze Hargreiues of Higham: whereupon Dandy answered, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> his best <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised>, and so vanished away: and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> saith, that since that time the said Hargreiues is dead; but how long after, this Examinate doth not now remember.
All which things, when he heard his sister <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her Oath <normalised orig="affirme" auto="true">affirm</normalised>, knowing them in his conscience to bee <normalised orig="iust" auto="true">just</normalised> and true, slenderly <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised> them, and thereupon insisted.

To this Examination were <normalised orig="diuerse" auto="true">diverse</normalised> witnesses examined in open Court <normalised orig="vina" auto="true">vine</normalised> voce, concerning the death of the parties, in such manner and <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised>, and at such time as the said <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised> in her <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> hath formerly declared to the Court.

Which is all, and I doubt not but matter sufficient in Law to charge him with, for the death of these parties.

For the <normalised orig="proofe" auto="true">proof</normalised> of his Practises, <normalised orig="Charmes" auto="true">Charms</normalised>, Meetings at Malking-Tower, to consult with Witches to execute <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised>, Master <normalised orig="Nowel" auto="true">Novel</normalised> humbly prayed; his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> Examination, taken and certified, might openly be read; and the rest in order, as they <normalised orig="remaine" auto="true">remain</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Record amongst the Records of the <normalised orig="Crowne" auto="true">Crown</normalised> at Lancaster: as hereafter <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>??? viz.

 



The Examination of IAMES DEVICE, <normalised orig="Sonne" auto="true">Son</normalised> of ELIZABETH DEVICE, of the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle: Taken the <normalised orig="seuen" auto="true">seven</normalised> and twentieth day of <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised> aforesaid, Before ROGER NOVVEL and NICHOLAS <normalised orig="BANESTER" auto="true">BANISTER</normalised> Esquires, two of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Peace within the said <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised>, viz.
ANd being examined, he further saith, That <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Sheare-Thursday last, in the <normalised orig="euening" auto="true">evening</normalised>, he this Examinate stole a <normalised orig="Wether" auto="true">Whether</normalised> from Iohn Robinson of Barley, and brought it to his Grand-mothers house, old Dembdike, and there killed it: and that <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the day following, being Good-Friday, about <normalised orig="twelue" auto="true">twelve</normalised> of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> in the day time, there dined in this Examinates mothers house a number of persons, whereof three were men, with this Examinate, and the rest women; and that they met there for three Causes following, as this Examinates said Mother told this Examinate.

1. The first was, for the naming of the Spirit which <normalised orig="Alizon" auto="true">Alison</normalised> <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised>, now prisoner at Lancaster, had, but did not name him, because she was not there.

2. The second Cause was, for the <normalised orig="deliuerie" auto="true">delivery</normalised> of his said Grand-mother; this Examinates said sister <normalised orig="Alizon" auto="true">Alison</normalised>; the said Anne Chattox, and her daughter, Redfernes; killing the <normalised orig="Gaoler" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> at Lancaster; and before the next <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised> to blow <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> the Castle there, to the end the aforesaid persons might by that <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> make an escape & get away: all which this Examinate then heard them <normalised orig="conferre" auto="true">confer</normalised> of.

3. And the third Cause was, for that there was a woman



dwelling in Gisborne Parish, who came into this Examinates said Grandmothers house, who there came and <normalised orig="craued" auto="true">craved</normalised> assistance of the rest of them that were then there, for the killing of Master Lister of Westby, because (as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> then said) he had borne malice <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> her, and had thought to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> put her away at the last <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised> at <normalised orig="Yorke" auto="true">York</normalised>, but could not and this Examinate heard the said woman say, That her power was not strong <normalised orig="ynough" auto="true">enough</normalised> to doe it her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, being now <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> then before time it had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised>.
And also, that the said <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> Preston had a Spirit with her like <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> a white <normalised orig="Foale" auto="true">Foal</normalised>, with a <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> spot in the <normalised orig="forhead" auto="true">forehead</normalised>.

And he also saith, That the names of the said Witches as were on Good-Friday at this Examinates said Grandmothers house, & now this Examinates <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> mothers, for so many of them as he did know, were these, viz. the wife of Hugh Hargreiues of Barley; the wife of Christopher Bulcock of the <normalised orig="Mosse" auto="true">Moss</normalised> end, and Iohn her <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised>; the mother of <normalised orig="Myles" auto="true">Miles</normalised> Nutter; Elizabeth, the wife of Christopher Hargreiues, of Thurniholme; Christopher Howgate, and Elizabeth his wife; Alice <normalised orig="Graye" auto="true">Gray</normalised> of Coulne, and one Mouldheeles wife, of the same: and this Examinate, and his Mother. And this Examinate further saith, That all the said Witches went out of the said House in their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> shapes and likenesses. And they all, by that they were forth of the <normalised orig="dores" auto="true">doors</normalised>, were gotten on <normalised orig="Horsebacke" auto="true">Horseback</normalised>, like <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> Foales, some of one colour, some of another; and Prestons wife was the last; and when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> got on <normalised orig="Horsebacke" auto="true">Horseback</normalised>, they all presently vanished out of this Examinates sight. And before their said parting away, they all appointed to <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> at the said Prestons

 


<normalised orig="wiues" auto="true">wives</normalised> house that day twelue-moneths; at which time the said Prestons wife promised to make them a great Feast. And if they had occasion to <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> in the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> time, then should warning be <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised>, that they all should <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Romleyes Moore.

But the next day <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> saith, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> came somewhat to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, and then the said Widow Southworth came <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to this Examinate to her bed-side, and <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her out of bed, and said to this Examinate, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did her no <normalised orig="harme" auto="true">harm</normalised> the other time, in respect of that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> now would after doe to her, and thereupon put her <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> a hey-stack, standing some three or <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> yards high from the earth, where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was found after great search made, by a neighbours Wife <normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> dwelling, and then laid in her bed <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, where she remained <normalised orig="speechlesse" auto="true">speechless</normalised> and <normalised orig="senselesse" auto="true">senseless</normalised> as before, by the space of two or three <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised>: And being <normalised orig="recouered" auto="true">recovered</normalised>, within a <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> after <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> saith, that the said Iane Southworth did come <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to this Examinate at her fathers house and did take her away, and laid her in a ditch <normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> to the house <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her face, and left her there, where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was found shortly after, and laid <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> a <normalised orig="bedde" auto="true">bed</normalised>, but had not her senses <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> of a day & a night, or thereabouts. And <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> further saith, that <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Tuesday last before the taking of this her Examination, the said Iane Southworth, came to this Examinates Fathers house, and finding this Examinate without the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>, <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> her and carried her into the <normalised orig="Barne" auto="true">Barn</normalised>, and thrust her head amongst a <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> of <normalised orig="boords" auto="true">boards</normalised> that were there standing, where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was shortly after found and laid in a <normalised orig="bedde" auto="true">bed</normalised>, and remained in her old fit till the Thursday at night following.
 


And being further examined touching her being at Red-bancke, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> saith, That the three women, by her before named, were carried <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> Ribble, by the same <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> things that carried them thither; and saith that at their said meeting in the Red-bancke, there did come also <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> other women, and did <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> them there, some old, some young, which this Examinate <normalised orig="thinketh" auto="true">thinks</normalised> did dwell <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the North-side of Ribble, because she saw them not come <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> the Water: but this Examinate knew none of them, neither did she see them eat or dance, or doe any thing else that the rest did, <normalised orig="sauing" auto="true">saving</normalised> that they were there and looked on.
These particular points of <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> being thus <normalised orig="vrged" auto="true">urged</normalised> against the Prisoners: the father of this Grace Sowerbutts prayed that Thomas Walshman, whose <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> they are charged to <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised>, might be examined as a <normalised orig="witnes" auto="true">witness</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his oath, for the Kings <normalised orig="Maiestie" auto="true">Majesty</normalised>, against the Prisoners at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>: who <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> this strange <normalised orig="deuised" auto="true">devised</normalised> accusation, <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> by this impudent wench, were in opinion of many of that great Audience guilty of this <normalised orig="bloudie" auto="true">bloody</normalised> <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised>, and more worthy to die then any of these Witches.

THe said Examinate, Thomas Walshman, <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his oath saith, That <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had a <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> died about Lent was twelue-month, who had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> by the space of a fortnight or three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised>, and was afterwards buried in Salmesburie Church: which <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> when it died was about a <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> old; But how it came to the death of it this Examinate <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> not. And he further saith, that about the fifteenth of <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised> last, or thereabouts, the said Grace Sowerbutts was found in this Examinates fathers <normalised orig="Barne" auto="true">Barn</normalised>, laid <normalised orig="vnder" auto="true">under</normalised> a little hay and straw, and from thence was carried into this Examinates house, and there laid till the Monday at night following: during which time <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did not speak, but lay as if she had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> dead.

 



The Examination of IOHN SINGLETON: Taken at Salmesbury, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, the <normalised orig="seuenth" auto="true">seventh</normalised> day of August: Anno Reg. Regis IACOBI <normalised orig="Angliae" auto="true">Anglia</normalised>, Franciae, & Hiberniae, Fidei Defensor. &c. Decimo & Scotiae, xlvj. Before ROBERT HOVLDEN, Esquire, one of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Peace in the County of Lancaster. Against. <normalised orig="IENNET" auto="true">JENNET</normalised> BIERLEY, ELLEN BIERLEY, and IANE SOVTHVVORTH, which hereafter <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>.
THe said Examinate <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his oath saith, That <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> hath often heard his old Master, Sir Iohn Southworth Knight, now deceased, say, touching the late wife of Iohn Southworth, now in the <normalised orig="Gaole" auto="true">Gaol</normalised>, for <normalised orig="suspition" auto="true">suspicion</normalised> of Witchcraft: That the said wife was as he thought an <normalised orig="euill" auto="true">evil</normalised> woman, and a Witch: and he said that he was sorry for her husband, that was his kinsman, for he thought she would kill him. And this Examinate further saith, That the said Sir Iohn Southworth in his <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> or going <normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised> his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> house at Salmesbury, and the <normalised orig="Towne" auto="true">Town</normalised> of Preston, did for the most part <normalised orig="forbeare" auto="true">forbear</normalised> to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> by the house, where the said wife dwelled, though it was his nearest and best way; and rode another way, only for <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> of the said wife, as this Examinate verily <normalised orig="thinketh" auto="true">thinks</normalised>.





The Examination of WILLIAM ALKER of Salmesbury, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, Yeoman: Taken the fifteenth day of <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised>, Anno Reg. Regis IACOBI, <normalised orig="Angliae" auto="true">Anglia</normalised>, Franciae, & Hiberniae, Decimo & Scotiae, quadragesimo quinto. Before ROBERT HOVLDEN, one of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Peace in the County of Lancaster: Against <normalised orig="IENNET" auto="true">JENNET</normalised> BIERLEY, ELLEN BIERLEY, and IANE BIERLEY, which hereafter <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>. viz.
THe said Examinate <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his oath saith, That <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> hath <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> the said Sir Iohn Southworth <normalised orig="shunne" auto="true">shun</normalised> to meet the said wife of Iohn Southworth, now Prisoner in the <normalised orig="Gaole" auto="true">Gaol</normalised>, when he came <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> where she was. And hath heard the said Sir Iohn Southworth say, that he liked her not, and that he doubted she would bewitch him.

Here was likewise Thomas Sowerbutts, father of Grace Sowerbutts, examined <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his oath, and many other witnesses to little purpose: who being examined by the Court, could depose little against them: But the finding of the wench <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the hay in her counterfeit fits: <normalised orig="wherfore" auto="true">wherefore</normalised> I <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> to trouble you with the particular declaration of their <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> against the Prisoners, In respect there was not any one <normalised orig="witnes" auto="true">witness</normalised> able to charge them with one direct matter of Withcraft; nor <normalised orig="proue" auto="true">prove</normalised> any thing for the <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised> of the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>.

Herein, before we come to the particular declaration of that wicked and damnable practise of this Iesuite or Seminary. I shall commend <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> your examination and <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> some points of her <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised>, wherein you

 


<normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> see what impossibilities are in this accusatio?? brought to this perfection, by the great care and <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> of this officious Doctor, Master Tompson or Southworth, who commonly <normalised orig="worketh" auto="true">works</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the Feminine disposition, being more <normalised orig="Passiue" auto="true">Passive</normalised> then <normalised orig="Actiue" auto="true">Active</normalised>.

The particular points of the <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> of GRACE SOVVERBVTTS, viz. <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised>.

THat for the space of some <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> she hath been haunted and vexed with some women, who <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> to come to her.
The Iesuite forgot to instruct his <normalised orig="Scholler" auto="true">Scholar</normalised> how long it is since she was tormented: it <normalised orig="seemes" auto="true">seems</normalised> it is long since he read the old Badge of a <normalised orig="Lyer" auto="true">Liar</normalised>, Oportet mendacem esse memorem. He <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised> not how long it is since they came to church, after which time they began to practise Witchcraft. It is a likely thing the Torment and <normalised orig="Panges" auto="true">Pangs</normalised> of Witchcraft can be forgotten; and therefore no time can be set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>.

<normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> saith that now lately these <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> women did violently draw her by the <normalised orig="haire" auto="true">hair</normalised> of the head, and lay her on the top of a Hay-mow.
<normalised orig="Heere" auto="true">Here</normalised> they <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> great violence to her, <normalised orig="whome" auto="true">whom</normalised> in another place they make <normalised orig="choise" auto="true">choice</normalised> to be of their <normalised orig="counsell" auto="true">counsel</normalised>, to go with them to the house of Walshman to <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised> the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>. This <normalised orig="courtesie" auto="true">curtsy</normalised> <normalised orig="deserues" auto="true">deserves</normalised> no <normalised orig="discouery" auto="true">discovery</normalised> of so <normalised orig="foule" auto="true">foul</normalised> a Fact.





Not long after, the said <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> Bierley did meet this Examinate <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> the place where she dwelled, and first appeared in her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="likenesse" auto="true">likeness</normalised>, and after that in the <normalised orig="likenesse" auto="true">likeness</normalised> of a <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> <normalised orig="Dogge" auto="true">Dog</normalised>.
<normalised orig="Vno" auto="true">La</normalised> & eodem tempore, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> transformed her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> into a <normalised orig="Dogge" auto="true">Dog</normalised>. I would know by what <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> any Priest can <normalised orig="maintaine" auto="true">maintain</normalised> this point of <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised>.

And as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> went <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> a Style, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> picked her <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised>, but had no hurt.
This is as likely to be true as the rest, to throw a child <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> from the <normalised orig="toppe" auto="true">top</normalised> of a House, and <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> hurt her great toe.

She rose <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>; had no hurt, went to her Aunt, and returned <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to her Fathers house, being fetched home.
I pray you <normalised orig="obserue" auto="true">observe</normalised> these contrarieties, in order as they are placed, to accuse the Prisoners.

<normalised orig="Saterday" auto="true">Saturday</normalised> the fourth of this instant <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised>.
Which was about the very day the Witches of the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle were sent to Lancaster. Now was the time for the <normalised orig="Seminarie" auto="true">Seminary</normalised> to instruct, accuse, and call into question these <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> women: for the <normalised orig="wrinckles" auto="true">wrinkles</normalised> of an old <normalised orig="wiues" auto="true">wives</normalised> face is good <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> to the <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> against a Witch. And how often will the common people say (Her eyes are <normalised orig="sunke" auto="true">sunk</normalised> in her head, GOD <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> vs from her.) But old Chattox had Faencie, besides her withered face, to accuse her.

 


This Examinate did <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> with the said <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> Bierley her Grand-mother, and Ellen Bierley her Aunt, to the house of Walshman, in the nighttime, to <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised> a Child in a strange manner.
This of all the rest is impossible, to make her of their <normalised orig="counsell" auto="true">counsel</normalised>, to doe <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised>, <normalised orig="whome" auto="true">whom</normalised> so cruelly and barbarously they pursue from day to day, and torment her. The Witches of the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle were <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> so <normalised orig="cruell" auto="true">cruel</normalised> nor barbarous.

And she also saith, the Child cried not when it was hurt.
All this time the Child was <normalised orig="asleepe" auto="true">asleep</normalised>, or the Child was of an <normalised orig="extraordinarie" auto="true">extraordinary</normalised> patience, ?? inauditum facinus!

After they had eaten, the said three women and this Examinate <normalised orig="daunced" auto="true">danced</normalised> <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> one of them with one of the <normalised orig="Blacke" auto="true">Black</normalised> things: and after, the <normalised orig="Blacke" auto="true">Black</normalised> things abused the said women.
Here is good <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> to take away their <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised>. This is more proper for the Legend of <normalised orig="Lyes" auto="true">Lies</normalised>, then the <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> of a <normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Oath, before a <normalised orig="reuerend" auto="true">reverend</normalised> and learned <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised>, able to <normalised orig="conceiue" auto="true">conceive</normalised> this <normalised orig="Villanie" auto="true">Villainy</normalised>, and <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> out the practise. Here is the Religious act of a Priest, but behold the <normalised orig="euent" auto="true">event</normalised> of it.

<normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> describes the <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> <normalised orig="Blacke" auto="true">Black</normalised> things to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> <normalised orig="vpright" auto="true">upright</normalised>, but not like Men in the face.
The <normalised orig="Seminarie" auto="true">Seminary</normalised> mistakes the face for the <normalised orig="feete" auto="true">feet</normalised>. For Chattox and all her fellow Witches agree, the <normalised orig="Deuill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> is clouen-footed: but <normalised orig="Fancie" auto="true">Fancy</normalised> had a very good face, and was a very proper Man.





About <normalised orig="tenne" auto="true">ten</normalised> <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> after her Examination taken at Black-borne, then she was tormented.
Still he pursues his <normalised orig="Proiect" auto="true">Project</normalised>: for hearing his <normalised orig="Scholler" auto="true">Scholar</normalised> had done well, he laboured she might doe more in this nature. But notwithstanding, many things are <normalised orig="layd" auto="true">laid</normalised> to be in the times when they were Papists: yet the Priest <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> to <normalised orig="discouer" auto="true">discover</normalised> them, nor instruct his <normalised orig="Scholler" auto="true">Scholar</normalised>, <normalised orig="vntill" auto="true">until</normalised> they came to Church. Then all this was the Act of GOD, to raise a child to open all things, and then to <normalised orig="discouer" auto="true">discover</normalised> his plotted <normalised orig="Tragedie" auto="true">Tragedy</normalised>. Yet in this great <normalised orig="discouerie" auto="true">discovery</normalised>, the <normalised orig="Seminarie" auto="true">Seminary</normalised> forgot to <normalised orig="deuise" auto="true">devise</normalised> a Spirit for them.

And for Thomas Walshman, <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his Oath he <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised>, That his Child had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> by the space of a fortnight, or three <normalised orig="weekes" auto="true">weeks</normalised>, before it died. And Grace Sowerbutts saith, they <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> it out of the <normalised orig="bedde" auto="true">bed</normalised>, <normalised orig="strucke" auto="true">struck</normalised> a <normalised orig="nayle" auto="true">nail</normalised> into the <normalised orig="Nauell" auto="true">Navel</normalised>, sucked <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>, <normalised orig="layd" auto="true">laid</normalised> it <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>; and after, <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> it out of the <normalised orig="Graue" auto="true">Grave</normalised>, with all the rest, as you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> heard. How these two agree, you may, <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> view of their <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised>, the better <normalised orig="conceiue" auto="true">conceive</normalised>, and be able to judge.

How well this <normalised orig="proiect" auto="true">project</normalised>, to take away the <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised> of three innocent <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> creatures by practise and <normalised orig="villanie" auto="true">villainy</normalised>; to induce a young <normalised orig="Scholler" auto="true">Scholar</normalised> to commit <normalised orig="periurie" auto="true">perjury</normalised>, to accuse her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> Grand-mother, Aunt, &c agrees either with the Title of a Iesuite, or the <normalised orig="dutie" auto="true">duty</normalised> of a Religious Priest, who should rather <normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised> <normalised orig="Sinceritie" auto="true">Sincerity</normalised> and <normalised orig="Innocencie" auto="true">Innocence</normalised>, then practise <normalised orig="Trecherie" auto="true">Treachery</normalised>: But this was <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>; for they are Heretikes accursed, to <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> of Priests; to frequent Churches, <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> the word of GOD preached, and <normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised> Religion sincerely.

 


But by the course of Times and Accidents, wise men <normalised orig="obserue" auto="true">observe</normalised>, that very <normalised orig="seldome" auto="true">seldom</normalised> hath any <normalised orig="mischieuous" auto="true">mischievous</normalised> attempt <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> vnder-taken without the direction or assistance of a Iesuit, or <normalised orig="Seminarie" auto="true">Seminary</normalised> Priest.
Who did not <normalised orig="condemne" auto="true">condemn</normalised> these Women <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> this <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised>, and hold them <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> of this so <normalised orig="foule" auto="true">foul</normalised> and horrible murder? But <normalised orig="Almightie" auto="true">Almighty</normalised> God, who in his <normalised orig="prouidence" auto="true">providence</normalised> had <normalised orig="prouided" auto="true">provided</normalised> <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> for their <normalised orig="deliuerance" auto="true">deliverance</normalised>, although the Priest by the <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Deuill" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, had <normalised orig="prouided" auto="true">provided</normalised> false witnesses to accuse them; yet GOD had prepared and placed in the <normalised orig="Seate" auto="true">Seat</normalised> of <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised>, an <normalised orig="vpright" auto="true">upright</normalised> <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> to sit in <normalised orig="Iudgement" auto="true">Judgment</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> their <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised>, who after he had heard all the <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> at large against the Prisoners for the Kings <normalised orig="Majestie" auto="true">Majesty</normalised>, demanded of them what <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> they could make. They humbly <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> their knees with weeping <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised>, desired him for Gods cause to examine Grace Sowerbuts, who set her on, or by whose <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> this accusation came against them.

Immediately the countenance of this Grace Sowerbuts changed: The witnesses being <normalised orig="behinde" auto="true">behind</normalised>, began to <normalised orig="quarrell" auto="true">quarrel</normalised> and accuse one an other. In the end his Lordship examined the <normalised orig="Girle" auto="true">Girl</normalised>, who could not for her life make any direct <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised>, but strangely amazed, told him, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was put to a Master to <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised>, but he told her nothing of this.

But here as his Lordships care and <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> was great to <normalised orig="discouer" auto="true">discover</normalised> the practises of these odious Witches of the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle, and other places, now <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> their <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> before him: So was he desirous to <normalised orig="discouer" auto="true">discover</normalised> this damnable practise, to accuse these <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> Women, and bring their <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised> in danger, and thereby to <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> the innocent.





And as he openly <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> it <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the Bench, in the hearing of this great Audience: That if a Priest or Iesuit had a hand in one end of it, there would <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> to bee <normalised orig="knauerie" auto="true">knavery</normalised>, and practise in the other end of it. And that it might the better <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> to the whole World, examined Thomas Sowerbuts, what Master taught his daughter: in <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> <normalised orig="termes" auto="true">terms</normalised>, he <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised> all.
The Wench had nothing to say, but her Master told her nothing of this. In the end, some that were present told his Lordship the truth, and the Prisoners informed him how <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> went to <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> with one Thompson a <normalised orig="Seminarie" auto="true">Seminary</normalised> Priest, who had instructed and taught her this accusation against them, because they were once obstinate Papists, and now came to Church. Here is the <normalised orig="discouerie" auto="true">discovery</normalised> of this Priest, and of his whole practise. Still this fire <normalised orig="encreased" auto="true">increased</normalised> more and more, and one <normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> accusing an other, all things were laid open at large.

In the end his Lordship <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> away the <normalised orig="Girle" auto="true">Girl</normalised> from her Father, and committed her to M. Leigh, a very religious Preacher, and M. Chisnal, two <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of the Peace, to be carefully examined. Who <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> great <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> to examine her of <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> particular point: In the end they came into the Court, and there <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> this Examination as <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>. ???

These Examinations being taken, they were brought into the Court, and there openly in the presence of this great Audience published, and declared to the <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> of Life and Death; and thereupon the Gentlemen of their <normalised orig="Iury" auto="true">Jury</normalised> required to consider of them. For although they stood <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> their <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, for matter of Fact of Witchcraft, <normalised orig="Murther" auto="true">Murder</normalised>, and much more of the like nature: yet in respect all their Accusations did <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> to bee practise: they were now to consider of them, and to acquit them. Thus were these <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> Innocent creatures, by the great care and <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> of this <normalised orig="honorable" auto="true">honourable</normalised> <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised>, <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> from the danger of this <normalised orig="conspiracie" auto="true">conspiracy</normalised>; this <normalised orig="bloudie" auto="true">bloody</normalised> practise of the Priest laid open: of whose fact I may lawfully say; Etiam si ego tacuero clamabunt <normalised orig="lapides" auto="true">lipids</normalised>.
These are but ordinary with Priests and Iesuites: no respect of <normalised orig="Bloud" auto="true">Blood</normalised>, kindred, or friendship, can <normalised orig="moue" auto="true">move</normalised> them to <normalised orig="forbeare" auto="true">forbear</normalised> their Conspiracies: for when he had laboured treacherously to seduce and <normalised orig="conuert" auto="true">convert</normalised> them, and yet could doe no good; then <normalised orig="deuised" auto="true">devised</normalised> he this <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised>.

God of his great <normalised orig="mercie" auto="true">mercy</normalised> <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> vs all from them and their damnable conspiracies: and when any of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="subiects" auto="true">subjects</normalised>, so free and innocent as these, shall come in question grant them as <normalised orig="honorable" auto="true">honourable</normalised> a <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised> as <normalised orig="Reuerend" auto="true">Reverend</normalised> and worthy a <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> to sit in <normalised orig="Iudgement" auto="true">Judgment</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> them; and in the end as <normalised orig="speedie" auto="true">speedy</normalised> a <normalised orig="deliuerance" auto="true">deliverance</normalised>. And for that which I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> heard of them; <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> with my eyes, and taken <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> to <normalised orig="Reade" auto="true">Read</normalised> of them: My humble prayer shall be to God <normalised orig="Almightie" auto="true">Almighty</normalised>.

Whereunto the said Spirit said, They are making three pictures: whereupon <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> asked, whose pictures they were? whereunto the said Spirit said, They are the pictures of Christopher Nutter, Robert Nutter, and Mary, wife of the said Robert Nutter. But this Examinate denying to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> to <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> them to make the pictures aforesaid, the said Spirit seeming to be <normalised orig="angrie" auto="true">angry</normalised> therefore, shot or pushed this Examinate into the Ditch; and so <normalised orig="shedde" auto="true">shed</normalised> the <normalised orig="milke" auto="true">milk</normalised> which this Examinate had in a <normalised orig="Kanne" auto="true">Can</normalised>, or Kitt: and so thereupon the Spirit at that time vanished out of this Examinates sight. But presently after that, the said Spirit appeared <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> this Examinate again in the shape of a Hare, and so went with her about a quarter of a <normalised orig="myle" auto="true">mile</normalised>, but said nothing <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> her this Examinate, nor <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> to it.

In which time of his <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, he did a hundred times at the least say, That the said Anne Redferne and her associates had bewitched him to death. And this Examinate further saith, That this Examinates Father, called Christopher Nutter, about Maudlint???de next after following fell <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised>, and so languished, <normalised orig="vntill" auto="true">until</normalised> Michaelmas then next after, and then died: during which time of his <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> did sundry times say, That <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was bewitched; but named no <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised> that should doe the same.

The Examination of IOHN NVTTER, of Higham Booth, in the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, yeoman, Against the said ANNE REDFERNE: Taken the day and <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> aforesaid, Before ROGER NOVVEL Esquire, one of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Peace in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster.
THis Examinate, <normalised orig="sworne" auto="true">sworn</normalised> & examined <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his oath, <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised>, That in or about Christmas, some <normalised orig="eighteene" auto="true">eighteen</normalised> or <normalised orig="nineteene" auto="true">nineteen</normalised> <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> <normalised orig="agoe" auto="true">ago</normalised>, this Examinat <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> from Burnley with Christopher Nutter and Robert Nutter, this Examinates Father and Brother, this Examinate heard



his said Brother then say <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> his said Father these words, or to this effect. Father, I am sure I am bewitched by the Chattox, Anne Chattox, and Anne Redferne her daughter, I pray you cause them to bee <normalised orig="layed" auto="true">laid</normalised> in Lancaster Castle: Whereunto this Examinates Father answered, Thou art a foolish <normalised orig="Ladde" auto="true">Lad</normalised>, it is not so, it is thy miscarriage. Then this Examinates Brother weeping, said; nay, I am sure that I am bewitched by them, and if <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> I come <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> (for <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was <normalised orig="readie" auto="true">ready</normalised> to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> to Sir Richard Shuttleworths, then his Master) I will procure them to bee laid where they shall be glad to bite Lice in two with their teeth.
Hereupon Anne Whittle, alias Chattox, her Mother, was brought forth to bee examined, who confessed the making of the pictures of Clay, and in the end cried out very heartily to God to <normalised orig="forgiue" auto="true">forgive</normalised> her <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised>, and <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her knees <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> for this Redferne, her daughter.

All men that knew her affirmed, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was more dangerous then her Mother, for <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> made all or most of the Pictures of Clay, that were made or found at any time. Wherefore I <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> her to make good <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of the little time she hath to repent in: but no <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> could <normalised orig="moue" auto="true">move</normalised> her to repentance, for as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="liued" auto="true">lived</normalised>, so <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> dyed.

Before Sir EDWARD BROMLEY Knight, one of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Assize, at Lancaster.

Alice Nutter.
THe two degrees of persons which chiefly practise Witch-craft, are such, as are in great <normalised orig="miserie" auto="true">misery</normalised> and <normalised orig="pouertie" auto="true">poverty</normalised>, for such the <normalised orig="Deuil" auto="true">Devil</normalised> allures to follow him, by promising great riches, and worldly <normalised orig="commoditie" auto="true">commodity</normalised>; Others, though rich, yet <normalised orig="burne" auto="true">burn</normalised> in a desperate desire of <normalised orig="Reuenge" auto="true">Revenge</normalised>; <normalised orig="Hee" auto="true">He</normalised> allures them by promises, to get their <normalised orig="turne" auto="true">turn</normalised> satisfied to their hearts contentment, as in the whole proceedings against old Chattox: the examinations of old Dembdike; and her children, there was not one of them, but <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> declared the like, when the <normalised orig="Deuill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> first assaulted them.

 


But to attempt this woman in that sort, the <normalised orig="Diuel" auto="true">Devil</normalised> had small <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised>: For it is <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> she was a rich woman; had a great estate, and children of good hope: in the common opinion of the world, of good temper, free from <normalised orig="enuy" auto="true">envy</normalised> or malice; yet whether by the <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> of the rest of the Witches, or some <normalised orig="vnfortunate" auto="true">unfortunate</normalised> occasion, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was <normalised orig="drawne" auto="true">drawn</normalised> to fall to this wicked course of life, I know not: but hither <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is now come to <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> her <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, both for Murder, and many other <normalised orig="vilde" auto="true">wild</normalised> and damnable practises.
Great was the care and <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> of his Lordship, to make <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Innocencie" auto="true">Innocence</normalised> of this woman, as shall <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> you <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the Examination of <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised>, in open Court, at the time of her <normalised orig="Arraignement" auto="true">Arraignment</normalised> and <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>; by an extraordinary <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> of <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, to <normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised> her out from the rest.

It is very <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> she was of the Grand-counsell at Malking-Tower <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Good-Friday, and was there present, which was a very great argument to <normalised orig="condemne" auto="true">condemn</normalised> her.

This Alice Nutter, Prisoner in the Castle at Lancaster: Being brought to the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised> before the Great Seat of <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised>; was there according to the former order and course Indicted and Arraigned, for that she <normalised orig="felloniously" auto="true">feloniously</normalised> had practised, exercised, and <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> her <normalised orig="diuellish" auto="true">devilish</normalised> and wicked Arts, called Witchcrafts, <normalised orig="Inchantments" auto="true">Enchantments</normalised>, <normalised orig="Charmes" auto="true">Charms</normalised> and Sorceries, in and <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Henry <normalised orig="Mitton" auto="true">Mitten</normalised>: and him the said Henry <normalised orig="Mitton" auto="true">Mitten</normalised>, by force of the same Witchcrafts, <normalised orig="felloniously" auto="true">feloniously</normalised> did kill and <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised>. <normalised orig="Contra" auto="true">Country</normalised> formam <normalised orig="Statuti" auto="true">Statute</normalised>, &c. Et <normalised orig="Contra" auto="true">Country</normalised> Pacem, &c.

<normalised orig="Vpon" auto="true">Upon</normalised> her <normalised orig="Arraignement" auto="true">Arraignment</normalised>, to this Indictment <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> pleaded not <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised>; and for the <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of her life, put



her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> God and the <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised>.
So as now the Gentlemen of the <normalised orig="Iury" auto="true">Jury</normalised> of life and death stand charged with her, as with others.

The Examination of IAMES DEVICE <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> of ELIZABETH DEVICE: Taken the <normalised orig="seuen" auto="true">seven</normalised> and twentieth day of <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised>: Anno Reg. Regis IACOBI <normalised orig="Angliae" auto="true">Anglia</normalised>, Franciae, & Hiberniae, Fidei Defensor. &c. Decimo & Scotiae, xlvj.

Against Alice Nutter.
THe said Examinate saith <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his oath, That <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> heard his Grand-mother say, about a <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> ago, that his mother, called Elizabeth <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised>, and his Grand-mother, and the wife of Richard Nutter,[7] of the Rough-Lee aforesaid, had killed one Henry <normalised orig="Mitton" auto="true">Mitten</normalised>, of the Rough-Lee aforesaid, by Witchcraft. The reason wherefore he was so killed, was for that this Examinats said Grand-mother had asked the said <normalised orig="Mitton" auto="true">Mitten</normalised> a penny: and <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> denying her thereof; thereupon <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> procured his death as aforesaid.

 



The Examination of ELIZABETH DEVICE, mother of the said IAMES DEVICE. Against ALICE NVTTER, wife of RICHARD NVTTER, Prisoner at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>, <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her <normalised orig="Arraignement" auto="true">Arraignment</normalised> and <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>. Before ROGER NOVVEL and NICHOLAS BANETER, Esquires, the day and <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> aforesaid.
THis Examinate <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her oath <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, and saith, That she, with the wife of Richard Nutter, called Alice Nutter, Prisoner at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>; and this Examinates said mother, Elizabeth Sotherne, alias Old Demdike; <normalised orig="ioyned" auto="true">joined</normalised> altogether, and bewitched the said Henry <normalised orig="Mitton" auto="true">Mitten</normalised> to death.

This Examinate further saith, That <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Good-friday last, there dined at this examinats house two women of Burneley Parish, whose names the said Richard Nutters wife, Alice Nutter, now Prisoner at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>, doth know.





The Examination of IAMES DEVICE aforesaid, Against The said ALICE NVTTER, the day and <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> aforesaid.
THe said Examinate <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his oath saith, That <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Good-Friday about <normalised orig="twelue" auto="true">twelve</normalised> of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> in the day time, there dined in this Examinats said mothers house, a number of persons, whereof three were men, with this Examinate, and the rest women: and that they <normalised orig="mette" auto="true">met</normalised> there for these three causes following, as this Examinats said mother told this Examinate.

The first was for the naming of the Spirit, which <normalised orig="Alizon" auto="true">Alison</normalised> <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised>, now Prisoner at Lancaster, had, but did not name him, because she was not there.

The second cause was, for the <normalised orig="deliuerie" auto="true">delivery</normalised> of his said Grand-mother; this Examinates said sister, <normalised orig="Alizon" auto="true">Alison</normalised>; the said Anne Chattox, and her daughter Redferne; killing the <normalised orig="Gaoler" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> at Lancaster, and before the next Assizes to blow <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> the Castle there; to the end that the foresaid Prisoners might by that <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> make an escape, and get away: all which this Examinate then heard them <normalised orig="conferre" auto="true">confer</normalised> of.

And he also saith, The names of such Witches as were on Good-Friday at this Examinats said Grand mothers house, and now this Examinates <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> mothers, for so many of them as he doth know, were amongst others, Alice Nutter, mother of <normalised orig="Myles" auto="true">Miles</normalised> Nutter, now Prisoner at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>. And this Examinate further saith, That all the said Witches went out of the said house in their

 


<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> shapes and likenesses; and they all, by that time they were forth of the <normalised orig="doores" auto="true">doors</normalised>, were gotten on horse-backe, like <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> Foales, some of one colour, and some of another; and Prestons wife was the last: and when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> got on horse-back, they all presently vanished out of this Examinates sight: and before their said parting away, they all appointed to <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> at the said Prestons <normalised orig="wifes" auto="true">wives</normalised> house that day <normalised orig="twelue" auto="true">twelve</normalised> month, at which time the said Prestons wife promised to make them a great feast: and if they had occasion to <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> in the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> time, then should warning be <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> to meet <normalised orig="vpo" auto="true">upon</normalised>?? Romleys Moore.

The Examination and <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> of <normalised orig="IENNET" auto="true">JENNET</normalised> DEVICE, daughter of ELIZABETH DEVICE. Against ALICE NVTTER, Prisoner at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>.
THe said Examinate saith, That on Good-Friday last, there was about 20. persons, whereof only two were men (to this Examinates remembrance) at her said Grand-mothers house at Malking-Tower, about <normalised orig="twelue" auto="true">twelve</normalised> of the clock; all which persons, this Examinats said mother <normalised orig="tould" auto="true">told</normalised> her, were Witches. And she further saith, she <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> the names of six of them, viz. the wife of Hugh Hargreiues <normalised orig="vnder" auto="true">under</normalised> Pendle, Christopher Howgate of Pendle, <normalised orig="Vncle" auto="true">Uncle</normalised> to this Examinat and Elizabeth his wife; and Dick <normalised orig="Myles" auto="true">Miles</normalised> wife of the Rough-Lee, Christopher <normalised orig="Iacks" auto="true">Jacks</normalised> of Thorniholme, and his wife; and the names of the residue, she this Examinate doth not know.





AFter these Examinations were openly read, his Lordship being very <normalised orig="suspitious" auto="true">suspicious</normalised> of the accusation of this <normalised orig="yong" auto="true">young</normalised> wench <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised>, commanded one to take her away into the <normalised orig="vpper" auto="true">upper</normalised> Hall, intending in the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> time to make <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised> of her <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised>, and the Accusation especially against this woman, who is charged to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> at Malking-Tower, at this great meeting. Master Couel was commanded to set all his Prisoners by <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised>, and betwixt <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> Witch another Prisoner, and some other strange women amongst them, so as no man could <normalised orig="iudge" auto="true">judge</normalised> the one from the other: and these being set in order before the Court from the prisoners, then was the Wench <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised> <normalised orig="commaunded" auto="true">commanded</normalised> to be brought into the Court: and being set before my Lord, he <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> great <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> to examine her of <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> particular Point, What women were at Malking-Tower <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Good-Friday? How she knew them? What were the names of any of them? And how she knew them to be such as she named?
In the end being examined by my Lord, Whether she knew them that were there by their faces, if she saw them? she told my Lord she should: whereupon in the presence of this great Audience, in open Court, she went and <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> Alice Nutter, this prisoner, by the hand, and accused her to be one: and told her in what place <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> sat at the Feast at Malking-Tower, at the great assembly of the Witches, and who sat next her: what conference they had, and all the rest of their proceedings at large, without any manner of <normalised orig="contrarietie" auto="true">contrariety</normalised>.

Being <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> further by his Lordship, Whether she knew Iohan a Style? she <normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised>, she knew no such <normalised orig="woma" auto="true">woman</normalised>?? to be there, neither did she <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> her name.

 


This could be no forged or false Accusation, but the very Act of GOD to <normalised orig="discouer" auto="true">discover</normalised> her.
Thus was no <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> left to doe her all indifferent <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised>, but it was <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> to <normalised orig="saue" auto="true">save</normalised> her life; and to this <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> no <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised>.

But nothing would <normalised orig="serue" auto="true">serve</normalised>: for old Dembdike, old Chattox, and others, had charged her with innocent <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>, which cries out for <normalised orig="Reuenge" auto="true">Revenge</normalised>, and will be satisfied.

Hereupon Master <normalised orig="Nowel" auto="true">Novel</normalised> standing <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised>, humbly prayed the <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised> of the Court, in respect this Fact of Witchcraft was more eminent and <normalised orig="apparant" auto="true">apparent</normalised> then the rest, that for the better satisfaction of the Audience, the Examination of Abraham Law might be read in Court.

which so long he hath endured for so small an offence, as you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> heard.
These things being thus openly published against her, and she knowing her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> to be <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> of <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> particular, humbly acknowledged the Indictment against her to be true, and that she was <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> of the offence therein contained, and that she had <normalised orig="iustly" auto="true">justly</normalised> <normalised orig="deserued" auto="true">deserved</normalised> death for that and many other such like: whereupon she was carried away, <normalised orig="vntill" auto="true">until</normalised> she should come to the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised> to <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> her judgement of death.

Oh, who was present at this lamentable spectacle, that was not <normalised orig="moued" auto="true">moved</normalised> with <normalised orig="pitie" auto="true">pity</normalised> to behold it!

Hereupon my Lord Gerard, Sir Richard Houghton, and others, who much pitied the <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> <normalised orig="Pedler" auto="true">Peddler</normalised>, At the <normalised orig="entreatie" auto="true">entreaty</normalised> of my Lord Bromley the <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised>, promised some present course should be taken for his <normalised orig="reliefe" auto="true">relief</normalised> and maintenance; being now discharged and sent away.

But here I may not let her <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised>; for that I find something more <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Record to charge her <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>: for although she were but a young Witch, of a <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> standing, and thereunto induced by Dembdike her Grand-mother, as you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> formerly heard, yet she was spotted with innocent <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> among the rest: for in one part of the Examination of Iames <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised>, her brother, he <normalised orig="deposeth" auto="true">deposes</normalised> as <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>, viz.

 



The Examination of IAMES DEVICE, brother to the said <normalised orig="ALIZON" auto="true">ALISON</normalised> DEVICE, Taken <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Oath Before ROGER NOVVEL Esquire, aforesaid, the thirtieth day of March, 1612.
IAmes <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised>, of the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, Labourer, <normalised orig="sworne" auto="true">sworn</normalised> and examined, <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised>, That about Saint Peters day last one Henry Bulcock came to the house of Elizabeth Sothernes, alias Dembdike, Grand-mother to this Examinate, and said, That the said <normalised orig="Alizon" auto="true">Alison</normalised> <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised> had bewitched a Child of his, and desired her, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> with him to his house: which accordingly <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> did: and thereupon <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> the said <normalised orig="Alizon" auto="true">Alison</normalised> fell <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> on her knees, and asked the said Bulcock <normalised orig="forgiuenesse" auto="true">forgiveness</normalised>; and confessed to him??? that she had bewitched the said Child, as this Examinate heard his said sister <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> him this Examinate.

And although <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> were <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> indicted for this offence, yet being matter <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Record??? I thought it <normalised orig="conuenient" auto="true">convenient</normalised> to <normalised orig="joyne" auto="true">join</normalised> it <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> her former Fact.

HEre the <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> of Life and Death <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> spent the most part of the day in due consideration of their offences, returned into the Court to <normalised orig="deliuer" auto="true">deliver</normalised> <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> their Verdict against them, as <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>.





The ??erdict of Life and Death.
WHo <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> their <normalised orig="Oathes" auto="true">Oaths</normalised> found Iohn Bulcock and Iane Bulcock his mother, not <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Felonie" auto="true">Felony</normalised> by Witch-craft, contained in the Indictment against them.

<normalised orig="Alizon" auto="true">Alison</normalised> <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised> <normalised orig="conuicted" auto="true">convicted</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> Confession.

Whereupon Master Couel was <normalised orig="commaunded" auto="true">commanded</normalised> by the Court to take away the Prisoners <normalised orig="conuicted" auto="true">convicted</normalised>, and to bring forth Margaret Pearson, and <normalised orig="Isabell" auto="true">Isabel</normalised> Robey, Prisoners in the Castle at Lancaster, to <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> their <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>.

Who were brought to their <normalised orig="Arraignement" auto="true">Arraignment</normalised> and <normalised orig="Trialls" auto="true">Trials</normalised>, as hereafter <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>, viz.

 



THE ARRAIGNMENT and <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised> of MARGARET PEARSON of Paddiham, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, for Witchcraft; the nineteenth of August 1612, at the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised> and <normalised orig="Generall" auto="true">General</normalised> Gaole-deliuerie, holden at Lancaster, Before Sir EDVVARD BROMLEY Knight, one of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Assise at Lancaster.

Margaret Pearson.
THus <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> I proceeded in hope your patience will endure the end of this discourse, which <normalised orig="craues" auto="true">craves</normalised> time, and were better not <normalised orig="begunne" auto="true">begun</normalised> at all, then not perfected.

This Margaret Pearson was the wife of Edward Pearson of Paddiham, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster; little <normalised orig="inferiour" auto="true">inferior</normalised> in her wicked and malicious course of life to any that hath gone before her: A very dangerous Witch of long continuance, generally suspected and feared in all parts of the <normalised orig="Countrie" auto="true">Country</normalised>, and of all good people <normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> her, and not without great cause: For <normalised orig="whosoeuer" auto="true">whosoever</normalised> <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> her any <normalised orig="iust" auto="true">just</normalised> occasion of offence, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> tormented



with great <normalised orig="miserie" auto="true">misery</normalised>, or cut off their children, goods, or friends.
This wicked and <normalised orig="vngodly" auto="true">ungodly</normalised> Witch <normalised orig="reuenged" auto="true">revenged</normalised> her <normalised orig="furie" auto="true">fury</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> goods, so that <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> one <normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> her sustained great <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised>. I place her in the end of these notorious Witches, by reason her <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> is of an other Nature, according to her offence; yet had not the <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised> and <normalised orig="mercie" auto="true">mercy</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> more then her desert, you had found her next to old Dembdike; for this is the third time <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is come to <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> her <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>; one time for murder by Witch-craft; an other time for bewitching a Neighbour; now for goods.

How long <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a Witch, the <normalised orig="Deuill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised> best.

The Accusations, Depositions, and particular Examinations <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Record against her are infinite, and were able to fill a large Volume; But since <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is now only to <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> her <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised> for this last offence. I shall <normalised orig="proceede" auto="true">proceed</normalised> against her in order, and set forth what matter we <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Record, to charge her <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>.

This Margaret Pearson, Prisoner in the Castle at Lancaster: Being brought to the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised> before the great Seat of <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised>; was there according to the course and order of the Law Indicted and Arraigned, for that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had practised, exercised, and <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> her <normalised orig="diuellish" auto="true">devilish</normalised> and wicked Arts, called Witchcrafts, <normalised orig="Inchantments" auto="true">Enchantments</normalised>, <normalised orig="Charmes" auto="true">Charms</normalised> and Sorceries, and one Horse or Mare of the goods and Chattels of one Dodgeson of Padiham, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, wickedly, maliciously, and voluntarily did kill. <normalised orig="Contra" auto="true">Country</normalised> formam <normalised orig="Statuti" auto="true">Statute</normalised>, &c. Et <normalised orig="contra" auto="true">country</normalised> Pacem dicti Domini Regis. &c.

 


<normalised orig="Vpon" auto="true">Upon</normalised> her <normalised orig="Arraignement" auto="true">Arraignment</normalised> to this Indictment, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> pleaded not <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised>; And for the <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of her life put her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> God and her <normalised orig="Countrie" auto="true">Country</normalised>.
So as now the Gentlemen of the <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> of her offence and death, stand charged with her as with others.

Neighbours doe require, which is to be <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> from the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> of such a dangerous, wicked, and malicious Witch. ???

THE IVDGEMENT OF THE RIGHT <normalised orig="HONORABLE" auto="true">HONOURABLE</normalised> Sir EDVVARD BROMLEY, Knight, one of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Assize at Lancaster <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the Witches <normalised orig="conuicted" auto="true">convicted</normalised>, as <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>.
THere is no man <normalised orig="aliue" auto="true">alive</normalised> more <normalised orig="vnwilling" auto="true">unwilling</normalised> to pronounce this <normalised orig="wofull" auto="true">woeful</normalised> and <normalised orig="heauy" auto="true">heavy</normalised> <normalised orig="Iudgement" auto="true">Judgment</normalised> against you, then my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>: and if it were possible, I would to God this cup might <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> from me. But since it is otherwise <normalised orig="prouided" auto="true">provided</normalised>, that after all proceedings of the Law, there must be a <normalised orig="Iudgement" auto="true">Judgment</normalised>; and the Execution of that <normalised orig="Iudgement" auto="true">Judgment</normalised> must succeed and follow in due time: I pray you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> patience to <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> that which the Law doth lay <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> you. You of all people <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> the least cause to <normalised orig="complaine" auto="true">complain</normalised>: since in the <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised> of your <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised> there hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> great care and <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> taken, and much time spent: and very few or none of you, but stand <normalised orig="conuicted" auto="true">convicted</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> your <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="voluntarie" auto="true">voluntary</normalised> confessions and Examinations, Ex ore proprio: Few Witnesses examined against you, but such as were present, and parties in your Assemblies. Nay I may further <normalised orig="affirme" auto="true">affirm</normalised>, What persons of your nature and condition, <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> were Arraigned and Tried with more <normalised orig="solemnitie" auto="true">solemnity</normalised>, had more <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised> <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> to <normalised orig="pleade" auto="true">plead</normalised> or <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> to <normalised orig="euerie" auto="true">every</normalised> particular point of <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> against you? In conclusion such hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> the

 


<normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> care of all, that had to <normalised orig="deale" auto="true">deal</normalised> with you, that you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> neither cause to be offended in the proceedings of the <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised>, that first <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> in these businesses, nor with the Court that hath had great care to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> nothing in <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> against you, but matter of fact; Sufficient matter <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Record, and not to induce, or <normalised orig="leade" auto="true">lead</normalised> the <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> to <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> any one of you <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> m??tter of <normalised orig="suspition" auto="true">suspicion</normalised> or presumption, nor with the witnesses who <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> tried, as it were in the fire: Nay, you cannot <normalised orig="denie" auto="true">deny</normalised> but must <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> what <normalised orig="extraordinarie" auto="true">extraordinary</normalised> <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> to make <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of their <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised>, and to <normalised orig="discouer" auto="true">discover</normalised> the least intended practice in any one of them, to touch your <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised> <normalised orig="vniustly" auto="true">unjustly</normalised>.
As you stand simply (your offences and <normalised orig="bloudie" auto="true">bloody</normalised> practises not considered) your fall would rather <normalised orig="moue" auto="true">move</normalised> compassion, then exasperate any man. For whom would not the <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> of so many <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> creatures at one time, touch, as in <normalised orig="apparance" auto="true">appearance</normalised> simple, and of little <normalised orig="vnderstanding" auto="true">understanding</normalised>?

But the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of those innocent children, and others his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Subiects" auto="true">Subjects</normalised>, whom cruelly and barbarously you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> murdered, and cut off, with all the rest of your offences, hath <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> out <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> the Lord against you, and <normalised orig="sollicited" auto="true">solicited</normalised> for satisfaction and <normalised orig="reuenge" auto="true">revenge</normalised>, and that hath brought this <normalised orig="heauie" auto="true">heavy</normalised> <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> you at this time.

It is therefore now time no longer wilfully to <normalised orig="striue" auto="true">strive</normalised>, both against the <normalised orig="prouidence" auto="true">providence</normalised> of God, and the <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised> of the Land: the more you labour to acquit your <normalised orig="selues" auto="true">selves</normalised>, the more <normalised orig="euident" auto="true">evident</normalised> and <normalised orig="apparant" auto="true">apparent</normalised> you make your offences to the World. And <normalised orig="vnpossible" auto="true">unpossible</normalised> it is that they shall either prosper or continue in this World, or <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> reward in the next, that are stained with so much innocent <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>.

The worst then I wish to you, standing at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised> <normalised orig="conuicted" auto="true">convicted</normalised>, to <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> your <normalised orig="Iudgement" auto="true">Judgment</normalised>, is, Remorse, and true Repentance,



for the <normalised orig="safegard" auto="true">safeguard</normalised> of your <normalised orig="Soules" auto="true">Souls</normalised>, and after??? an humble, penitent, and <normalised orig="heartie" auto="true">hearty</normalised> acknowledgement of your <normalised orig="grieuous" auto="true">grievous</normalised> <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised> and offences committed both against GOD and Man.
First, <normalised orig="yeeld" auto="true">yield</normalised> humble and <normalised orig="heartie" auto="true">hearty</normalised> <normalised orig="thankes" auto="true">thanks</normalised> to <normalised orig="Almightie" auto="true">Almighty</normalised> GOD for taking hold of you in your beginning, and making stay of your intended <normalised orig="bloudie" auto="true">bloody</normalised> practises (although GOD <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised> there is too much done <normalised orig="alreadie" auto="true">already</normalised>) which would in time <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> cast so great a weight of <normalised orig="Iudgement" auto="true">Judgment</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> your <normalised orig="Soules" auto="true">Souls</normalised>.

Then praise GOD that it pleased him not to <normalised orig="surprize" auto="true">surprise</normalised> or strike you suddenly, <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> in the execution of your <normalised orig="bloudie" auto="true">bloody</normalised> <normalised orig="Murthers" auto="true">Murders</normalised>, and in the <normalised orig="middest" auto="true">midst</normalised> of your wicked practises, but hath <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> you time, and takes you away by a <normalised orig="iudiciall" auto="true">judicial</normalised> course and <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of the Law.

Last of all, <normalised orig="craue" auto="true">crave</normalised> pardon of the World, and especially of all such as you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="iustly" auto="true">justly</normalised> offended, either by tormenting <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised>, children, or friends, murder of their kinsfolks, or <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> of any their goods.

And for <normalised orig="leauing" auto="true">leaving</normalised> to future times the president of so many barbarous and <normalised orig="bloudie" auto="true">bloody</normalised> murders, with such meetings, practises, consultations, and <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> to execute <normalised orig="reuenge" auto="true">revenge</normalised>, being the greatest part of your comfort in all your actions, which may instruct others to hold the like course, or fall in the like sort:

Notwithstanding, the <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> of the Court, is, You shall all enter Recognizances with good sufficient Suerties, to <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> at the next Assizes at Lancaster, and in the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> time to be of the good <normalised orig="behauiour" auto="true">behaviour</normalised>. All I can say to you:

 


<normalised orig="Jennet" auto="true">Janet</normalised> Bierley,
Ellen Bierley,
Jane Southworth,
is, That GOD hath <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> you beyond expectation, I pray GOD you may <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> this <normalised orig="mercie" auto="true">mercy</normalised> and <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised> well; and take heed you fall not hereafter: And so the Court doth order you shall be <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised>.
What more can bee written or published of the proceedings of this <normalised orig="honorable" auto="true">honourable</normalised> Court: but to conclude with the Execution of the Witches, who were executed the next day following at the common place of Execution, <normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> Lancaster. Yet in the end <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> to <normalised orig="intreate" auto="true">entreat</normalised> some <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised> that <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> afraid to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> <normalised orig="vntill" auto="true">until</normalised> my <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> were finished. If I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> omitted any thing <normalised orig="materiall" auto="true">material</normalised>, or published any thing imperfect, excuse me for that I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> done: It was a <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> imposed <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> me by the <normalised orig="Iudges" auto="true">Judges</normalised> in respect I was so <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> instructed in <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> particular. In hast I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="vndertaken" auto="true">undertaken</normalised> to finish it in a <normalised orig="busie" auto="true">busy</normalised> <normalised orig="Tearme" auto="true">Term</normalised> amongst my other imploiments.

My charge was to publish the proceedings of <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised>, and matter of Fact, wherein I wanted <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised> to write what I would, and am limited to set forth nothing against them, but matter <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Record, <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> in their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="Countrie" auto="true">Country</normalised> <normalised orig="tearmes" auto="true">terms</normalised>, which may <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> strange. And this I hope will <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> good satisfaction to such as <normalised orig="vnderstand" auto="true">understand</normalised> how to <normalised orig="iudge" auto="true">judge</normalised> of a <normalised orig="businesse" auto="true">business</normalised> of this nature. Such as <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> no other <normalised orig="imploiment" auto="true">employment</normalised> but to question other <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> Actions, I <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> them to censure what they please, It is no part of my profession to publish any thing in



print, neither can I paint in <normalised orig="extraordinarie" auto="true">extraordinary</normalised> <normalised orig="tearmes" auto="true">terms</normalised>. But if this <normalised orig="discouerie" auto="true">discovery</normalised> may <normalised orig="serue" auto="true">serve</normalised> for your instruction, I shall <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> very <normalised orig="happie" auto="true">happy</normalised> in this <normalised orig="Seruice" auto="true">Service</normalised>, and so <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> it to your <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> censure.

But such was her execrable Ingratitude, as <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> this grace and <normalised orig="goodnesse" auto="true">goodness</normalised> was the cause of his miserable and <normalised orig="vntimely" auto="true">untimely</normalised> death.

But this <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised> and <normalised orig="mercie" auto="true">mercy</normalised> was no sooner extended <normalised orig="towardes" auto="true">towards</normalised> her, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> set at <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised>, But <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> began to practise the <normalised orig="vtter" auto="true">utter</normalised> <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> and <normalised orig="ouerthrow" auto="true">overthrow</normalised> of the name and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of this Gentleman.

Which it pleased God in his <normalised orig="mercie" auto="true">mercy</normalised> to <normalised orig="discouer" auto="true">discover</normalised>, and in the end, <normalised orig="howsoeuer" auto="true">howsoever</normalised> he had blinded her, as he did the King of <normalised orig="Aegypt" auto="true">Egypt</normalised> and his Instruments, for the brighter <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> of his own <normalised orig="powerfull" auto="true">powerful</normalised> glory; Yet by a <normalised orig="Iudiciall" auto="true">Judicial</normalised> course and <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of the Law, cut her off, and so <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> his people from the danger of her <normalised orig="Deuilish" auto="true">Devilish</normalised> and wicked practises: which you shall <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> against her, at her <normalised orig="Arraignement" auto="true">Arraignment</normalised> and <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, which I shall now set forth to you in order as it was performed, with the <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> and tokens of GOD, to <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> the <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> to <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> her <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> of this <normalised orig="bloudie" auto="true">bloody</normalised> <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised>, committed <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> since.

Which being done, and the Prisoner at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised> to <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> her <normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, Master Heyber, one of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Peace in the same County, <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> taken great <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> in the proceedings against her; and being best instructed of any man of all the particular points of <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> against her, humbly prayed, the witnesses hereafter following might be examined against her, and the <normalised orig="seuerall" auto="true">several</normalised> Examinations, taken before Master <normalised orig="Nowel" auto="true">Novel</normalised>, and certified, might openly bee published against her; which hereafter follow in order, viz.

The <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> for the Kings <normalised orig="Maiestie" auto="true">Majesty</normalised> Against <normalised orig="IENNET" auto="true">JENNET</normalised> PRESTON, Prisoner at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>.
HEreupon were <normalised orig="diuerse" auto="true">diverse</normalised> Examinations taken and read openly against her, to induce and <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> the Gentlemen of the <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> of Life and Death, to <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> she was a Witch; and many other circumstances for the death of M. Lister. In the end Anne Robinson and others were both examined, who <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> their <normalised orig="Oathes" auto="true">Oaths</normalised> declared against her, That M. Lister lying in great <normalised orig="extremitie" auto="true">extremity</normalised>, <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his death-bedde, cried out <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> them that stood about him; that <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> Preston was in the house, <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> where <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is, take hold of her: for Gods sake shut the <normalised orig="doores" auto="true">doors</normalised>, and take her, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> cannot escape away. <normalised orig="Looke" auto="true">Look</normalised> about for her, and lay hold on her, for <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is in the house: and so <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> very often in his great <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised>, to them that came to visit him during his <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>.


Anne Robinson, and Thomas Lister
Being examined further, they both <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> this in <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> against her, That when Master Lister lay <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his death-bedde, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> out in great <normalised orig="extremitie" auto="true">extremity</normalised>; <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> Preston <normalised orig="lyes" auto="true">lies</normalised> <normalised orig="heauie" auto="true">heavy</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> me, Prestons wife <normalised orig="lyes" auto="true">lies</normalised> <normalised orig="heauie" auto="true">heavy</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> me; <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> me, <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> me: and so departed, crying out against her.

These, with many other witnesses, were further examined, and deposed, That <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> Preston, the Prisoner at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>, being brought to M. Lister after <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was dead, & <normalised orig="layd" auto="true">laid</normalised> out to be wound <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> in his winding-sheet, the said <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> Preston <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> to touch the dead <normalised orig="corpes" auto="true">corpse</normalised>, they bled fresh <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> presently, in the presence of all that were there present: Which hath <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> held a great argument to induce a <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> to hold him <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> that shall be accused of <normalised orig="Murther" auto="true">Murder</normalised>, and hath <normalised orig="seldome" auto="true">seldom</normalised>, or <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised>, <normalised orig="fayled" auto="true">failed</normalised> in the <normalised orig="Tryall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>.
But these were not alone: for this wicked and bloud-thirstie Witch was no sooner <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> at the <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised> holden at <normalised orig="Yorke" auto="true">York</normalised> in Lent last past, being indicted, arraigned, and by the <normalised orig="fauor" auto="true">favour</normalised> and <normalised orig="mercie" auto="true">mercy</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> found not <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised>, for the <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised> of a Child by Witch-craft: but <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the Friday following, <normalised orig="beeing" auto="true">being</normalised> Good-Friday, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> rode in hast to the great meeting at Malking-Tower, and there prayed aide for the <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised> of M. Thomas Lister: as at large shall <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised>, by the <normalised orig="seuerall" auto="true">several</normalised> Examinations hereafter following; sent to these <normalised orig="Assises" auto="true">Assizes</normalised> from Master <normalised orig="Nowel" auto="true">Novel</normalised> and other his Majesties <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Peace in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, to be <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> in <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> against her, <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her <normalised orig="Triall" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, viz.

The Examination and <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised> of IAMES DEVICE, of the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, Labourer, taken at the house of IAMES WILSEY, of the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, the <normalised orig="seuen" auto="true">seven</normalised> and twentieth day of <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised>, Anno Reg. Regis IACOBI <normalised orig="Angliae" auto="true">Anglia</normalised>, &c. Decimo ac Scotiae quadragesimo quinto. Before ROGER NOVVEL, and NICHOLAS <normalised orig="BANESTER" auto="true">BANISTER</normalised>, Esquires, two of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of the Peace within the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, viz.
THis Examinate saith, That <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Good-Friday last about <normalised orig="twelue" auto="true">twelve</normalised> of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> in the day-time, there dined in this Examinates said mothers house a number of persons, whereof three were men, with this Examinate, and the rest women: and that they met there for these three causes following (as this Examinates said mother told this Examinate): First was for the naming of the Spirit, which <normalised orig="Alizon" auto="true">Alison</normalised> <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised>, now Prisoner at Lancaster, had, but did not name him, because <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was not there. The second cause was for the <normalised orig="deliuery" auto="true">delivery</normalised> of his said Grand-mother, this Examinates said sister <normalised orig="Alizon" auto="true">Alison</normalised>, the said Anne Chattox, and her daughter Redferne: Killing the <normalised orig="Gaoler" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> at Lancaster; and before the next Assizes to blow <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> the Castle there; to that end the aforesaid Prisoners might by that <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> make an escape and get away. All which this Examinate then heard them <normalised orig="conferre" auto="true">confer</normalised> of. And the third cause was, for that there was a woman dwelling in Gisburne Parish, who came into this Examinates said Grand-mothers

house, who there came, and <normalised orig="craued" auto="true">craved</normalised> assistance of the rest of them that were then there, for the killing of Master Lister of Westby: because, as she then said, he had borne malice <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> her, and had thought to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> put her away at the last Assizes at <normalised orig="Yorke" auto="true">York</normalised>; but could not. And then this Examinat heard the said woman say, that her power was not strong enough to doe it her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, being now <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> then before-time it had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised>.
And he also further saith, That the said Prestons wife had a Spirit with her like <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> a white <normalised orig="Foale" auto="true">Foal</normalised>, with a blacke-spot in the forehead. And further, this Examinat saith, That since the said meeting, as aforesaid, this Examinate hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> brought to the wife of one Preston in Gisburne Parish aforesaid, by Henry Hargreiues of Goldshey to see whether <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was the woman that came amongst the said Witches, on the said last Good-Friday, to <normalised orig="craue" auto="true">crave</normalised> their aide and assistance for the killing of the said Master Lister: and <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> had full view of her; <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> this Examinate <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, That she was the <normalised orig="selfe-same" auto="true">selfsame</normalised> woman which came amongst the said Witches on the said last Good-Friday, for their aide for the killing of the said Master Lister; and that brought the Spirit with her, in the shape of a White <normalised orig="Foale" auto="true">Foal</normalised>, as aforesaid.

And this Examinate further saith, That all the said Witches went out of the said house in their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> shapes and likenesses, and they all, by that they were forth of the <normalised orig="doores" auto="true">doors</normalised>, were gotten on horse-backe like <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> Foales, some of one colour, some of another, and Prestons wife was the last; and when she got on <normalised orig="horsebacke" auto="true">horseback</normalised>, they all presently vanished out of this Examinats sight: and before their said parting away, they all appointed to <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> at the said Prestons <normalised orig="wifes" auto="true">wives</normalised> house that

day twelue-month; at which time the said Prestons wife promised to make them a great feast; and if they had occasion to meet in the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> time, then should warning bee <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> that they all should <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Romles-Moore. And this Examinate further saith, That at the said feast at Malking-Tower, this Examinat heard them all <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> their consents to put the said Master Thomas Lister of Westby to death: and after Master Lister should be made away by Witchcraft, then al the said Witches <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> their consents to <normalised orig="ioyne" auto="true">join</normalised> altogether to hancke Master Leonard Lister, when he should come to dwell at the Sowgill, and so put him to death.

The Examination of HENRIE HARGREIVES of Goldshey-booth, in the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster Yeoman, taken the fifth day of May, Anno Reg. Regis IACOBI <normalised orig="Angliae" auto="true">Anglia</normalised>, &c. Decimo, ac Scociae quadragesimo quinto. Before ROGER NOVVEL, NICHOLAS <normalised orig="BANNESTER" auto="true">BANISTER</normalised>, and ROBERT HOLDEN, Esquires; three of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Peace within the said <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised>.
THis Examinat <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his oath saith, That Anne Whittle, alias Chattox, confessed <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> him, that she <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> one Prestons wife <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> Gisburne, and that the said Prestons wife should <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> at the said feast, <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the said Good-Friday, and that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was an ill woman, and had done Master Lister of Westby great hurt.


The Examination of ELIZABETH DEVICE, mother of IAMES DEVICE, taken before ROGER NOVVELL and NICHOLAS <normalised orig="BANESTER" auto="true">BANISTER</normalised>, Esquires, the day and <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> aforesaid, viz.
THe said Elizabeth <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her Examination <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>. That <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Good-Friday last, there dined at this Examinats house, which she hath said are Witches, and doth verily <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> them to be Witches; and their names are those whom Iames <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised> hath formerly spoken of to be there.

She also <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised> in all things touching the killing of Master Lister of Westby, as the said Iames <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised> hath before confessed.

And the said Elizabeth <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised> also further saith, That at the said meeting at Malking-Tower, as aforesaid, the said Katherine Hewyt and Iohn Bulcock, with all the rest then there, <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> their consents, with the said Prestons wife, for the killing of the said Master Lister. And for the killing of the said Master Leonard Lister, she this Examinate saith in all things, as the said Iames <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised> hath before confessed in his Examination.


The Examination of <normalised orig="IENNET" auto="true">JENNET</normalised> DEVICE, daughter of ELIZABETH late wife of IOHN DEVICE, of the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised> of Pendle, in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster, about the age of nine <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> or thereabouts, taken the day and <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> aboue-said: Before ROGER NOVVEL and NICHOLAS <normalised orig="BANESTER" auto="true">BANISTER</normalised>, Esquires, two of his <normalised orig="Maiesties" auto="true">Majesties</normalised> <normalised orig="Iustices" auto="true">Justices</normalised> of Peace in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster.
THe said Examinate <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> her Examination saith, that <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Good-friday last there was about twenty persons, whereof only two were men, to this Examinats remembrance, at her said Grand???mothers house, called Malking-Tower aforesaid, about <normalised orig="twelue" auto="true">twelve</normalised> of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised>: all which persons, this Examinates said mother told her were Witches, and that she <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> the names of <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> of the said Witches.

AFter all these Examinations, Confessions, and <normalised orig="Euidence" auto="true">Evidence</normalised>, <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> in open Court against her, His Lordship commanded the <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> to <normalised orig="obserue" auto="true">observe</normalised> the particular circumstances; first, Master Lister in his great <normalised orig="extremitie" auto="true">extremity</normalised>, to <normalised orig="complaine" auto="true">complain</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> saw her, and requested them that were by him to lay hold on her.
After he cried out <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> lay <normalised orig="heauie" auto="true">heavy</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> him, <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> at the time of his death.

But the Conclusion is of more consequence then all the rest, that <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> Preston being brought to the dead corps, they bled freshly, And after her <normalised orig="deliuerance" auto="true">deliverance</normalised> in Lent, it is <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> rode <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> a white <normalised orig="Foale" auto="true">Foal</normalised>, and was present in the great assembly at Malkin Tower with the Witches, to <normalised orig="intreat" auto="true">entreat</normalised> and pray for aide of them, to kill Master Lister, now <normalised orig="liuing" auto="true">living</normalised>, for that he had prosequuted against her.

And against these people you may not expect such direct <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised>, since all their <normalised orig="workes" auto="true">works</normalised> are the <normalised orig="workes" auto="true">works</normalised> of <normalised orig="darkenesse" auto="true">darkness</normalised>, no witnesses are present to accuse them, therefore I pray God direct your consciences.

After the Gentlemen of the <normalised orig="Iurie" auto="true">Jury</normalised> of Life and Death had spent the most part of the day, in consideration of the <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> against her, they returned into the Court and <normalised orig="deliuered" auto="true">delivered</normalised> <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> their Verdict of Life and Death. ???



The ??erdict of Life and Death.
WHo found <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> Preston <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> of the <normalised orig="fellonie" auto="true">felony</normalised> and murder by Witch-craft of Thomas Lister, Esquire; <normalised orig="conteyned" auto="true">contained</normalised> in the Indictment against her, &c.

Afterwards, according to the course and order of the <normalised orig="Lawes" auto="true">Laws</normalised>, his Lordship pronounced <normalised orig="Iudgement" auto="true">Judgment</normalised> against her to bee hanged for her offence. And so the Court arose.

HEre was the <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> <normalised orig="discouerie" auto="true">discovery</normalised> of this <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> Preston, who for so many <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> had <normalised orig="liued" auto="true">lived</normalised> at Gisborne in <normalised orig="Crauen" auto="true">Craven</normalised>, <normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> Master Lister: one thing more I shall <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised> to all these particular Examinations, and <normalised orig="euidence" auto="true">evidence</normalised> of witnesses, which I saw, and was present in the Court at Lancaster, when it was done at the Assizes holden in August following.

My Lord Bromley being very suspicious of the accusation of <normalised orig="Iennet" auto="true">Jennet</normalised> <normalised orig="Deuice" auto="true">Device</normalised>, the little Wench, commanded her to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the Prisoners that were present, and declare which of them were present at Malkin Tower, at the great assembly of Witches <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> Good-Friday last: <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> looked <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> and <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> many by the <normalised orig="handes" auto="true">hands</normalised>, and accused them to be there, and when <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had accused all that were there present, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> told his Lordship there was a Woman that came out of <normalised orig="Crauen" auto="true">Craven</normalised> that was


amongst the Witches at that Feast, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> saw her not amongst the Prisoners at the <normalised orig="Barre" auto="true">Bar</normalised>.
What a singular note was this of a Child, amongst many to <normalised orig="misse" auto="true">miss</normalised> her, that before that time was hanged for her offence, which <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> or declare at her death? here was present old Preston her husband, who then cried out and went away: being fully satisfied his wife had <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised>, and was <normalised orig="worthie" auto="true">worthy</normalised> of death.

To conclude then this present discourse, I <normalised orig="heartilie" auto="true">heartily</normalised> desire you, my <normalised orig="louing" auto="true">loving</normalised> Friends and <normalised orig="Countrie-men" auto="true">Countrymen</normalised>, for whose particular instructions this is added to the former of the <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> <normalised orig="discouerie" auto="true">discovery</normalised> of Witches in the <normalised orig="Countie" auto="true">County</normalised> of Lancaster: And for whose particular satisfaction this is published; Awake in time, and suffer not your <normalised orig="selues" auto="true">selves</normalised> to be thus assaulted.

Consider how barbarously this Gentleman hath been dealt <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>; and especially you that hereafter shall <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">posse</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> any <normalised orig="Iuries" auto="true">Juries</normalised> of Life and Death, let not your conniuence, or rather foolish <normalised orig="pittie" auto="true">pity</normalised>, spare such as these, to exequute farther <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised>.

Remember that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was no sooner set at <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised>, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> plotted the <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> and <normalised orig="ouerthrow" auto="true">overthrow</normalised> of this Gentleman, and his whole <normalised orig="Familie" auto="true">Family</normalised>.

Expect not, as this <normalised orig="reuerend" auto="true">reverend</normalised> and learned <normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised> saith, such apparent <normalised orig="proofe" auto="true">proof</normalised> against them, as against others, since all their <normalised orig="workes" auto="true">works</normalised>, are the <normalised orig="workes" auto="true">works</normalised> of <normalised orig="darkenesse" auto="true">darkness</normalised>: and <normalised orig="vnlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> it please <normalised orig="Almightie" auto="true">Almighty</normalised> God to raise witnesses to accuse them, who is able to <normalised orig="condemne" auto="true">condemn</normalised> them?

Forget not the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> that cries out <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> God for <normalised orig="reuenge" auto="true">revenge</normalised>, bring it not <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> your <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> heads.

Neither doe I <normalised orig="vrge" auto="true">urge</normalised> this any farther, then with this, that I would <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> <normalised orig="intreat" auto="true">entreat</normalised> you to remember, that it is

as great a crime (as <normalised orig="Salomon" auto="true">Solomon</normalised> <normalised orig="sayth" auto="true">saith</normalised>, <normalised orig="Prov" auto="true">Prove</normalised>. 17) to <normalised orig="condemne" auto="true">condemn</normalised> the innocent, as to let the <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> escape free.
