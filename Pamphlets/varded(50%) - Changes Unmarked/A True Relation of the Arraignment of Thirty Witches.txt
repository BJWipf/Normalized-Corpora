The Confession of Rebecca West, daughter to Anne WEst of Colchester in Essex.

The said REbecca confessed at the Bar, that about Shrovetide last her mother bad her make haste of her work, for she must go along with her before Sun down: and as they were going over the fields, her mother gave her a great charge never to speak of wahat she could hear or see, and she faithfully promised to keep counsel. When she came ot the house of meeting there were five Witches more; the two chief were Mother Benefield and Mother Goodwin; this Mother Goodwin pulled out a Book, and after their manner they prayed out of it, and presently their several Imps appeared in several shapes: six whereof appeared in the shapes of Kitnens about a week old in Mother Benefield's lap, and after she had kissed them, she said unto Rebecca that those were all her children which she had by as handsome a man as any was in England. Then they commanded their Spirits come to kill such a mans Horse, some a cow, some a Chi'de, etc. Then Mother Benefield called to mother West and asked if she were sure that her daugther REbecca would keep counsel, or else tshe might seek all their blood. She answered, Rebecca had promised. They all replied, if she ever did spake of it that she should suffer more tortures and pains on earth, then the paeans of hell. Presently mother Benefield said, for more certainty let her take out Covenant and Oath as we have already done. Then they taught her waht to say, the sum where of was to deny God and her SAviour Iesus Crhist, to renounce all promises of his blessings, and the merits of his bitter death and passion, to believe as they did, and to serve and obey as they did. And the said Rebecca confessed that so soon as she had done thus, the Devil in the shsape of a little black dog leaped into her lap, & kissed her three times, but she felt them very cold. Shortly after, when she was going to bed, the Devil appeared unto her again in the shape of a handsome young man, saying that he came ot marry her. The manner was thus: he took her by the hand, and leading her about the room, said, I take thee Rebecca to be my wife, and do promise to by they loving husband till death, defending thee from all harms; then he told her what she must say, hwereupon she took him by the hand and said, I Rebecca take thee to be my husband, and doe promise to be an obedient wife till death, faithfully to perform and observe all they commands; and the first whereof was that she should deny and renounce as aforesaid. And being asked by the Judge whether she ever had carnal copulation with the Devil, she confessed that she had. And being asked divers questions by a Gentleman that did speak several times with her before and afterword (giving her godly and comfortable instructions) she affirmed that so soon as one of the Witches was is prison, she was very desrious to confess all she knew, which accordingly she did, whereupon the rest were apprehended and sent unto the Gaol. She further affirmed, that when she was going to the Grand Inquest with one mother Miller (indicted for a Witch) she told mother Miller that she would confess nothing, if the pulled her to pieces with pincers: and being asked the reason by the Gentleman, she said she found her self in such extremeity of torture and amazement, that she would not endure it again for the world: and when she looked upon the ground she saw her self encompssed in flames of fire: and presently the Grand Inquest called for her, where they admit but one at a time, and so soon as she was thus separated from this mother Miller, the tortures and the flames began to cease: whereupon she then confessed all she ever knew, and said that so soon as her confession was fully ended, she found her conscience so tagiued and disburdened of all her torture, that she thought her self the happiest creature in the world: withal affirming that the Devil can take any shape, and speak plain English.

Another witch sent her maid to a neighbours house for a handful of herbs, who meeting iwht her sweetheart staid an hour by the way, saying she should bee half hanged for staying so long: whereupon he told her that in such a place in their own garden there grew the same herbs, so it was but oging over the pale and her journey was ended; which she did, and pleased her mistress well for her long stay, by bringing those herbs. At night her mistress bade her go up to bed first, which made her mistrust something; whereupon she peeked between the boards and observed her mistress to cut the herbs in small pieces, strewing them about the room: the next morning her husband rising betimes found twelve or fourteen great Hogs, being all his own, dead in the yard, and so for his Sheep all his other Cattle, and telling his wife how they were undone, she replied, hath the queen served me thus? She shall suffer for it. Then he examined the maid, and both gave evidence. This was at Ipswich in Suffolk.

The evidnece of Mr. Long a Minister near Cholchester in Essex.

First, that as he was riding on the way, the hsape of a red dog passed by him, at which his blood did rise; and being passed a small distance, turned his face, his eyes appearing nor like the eyes of any creature, his horse presently started, and never lefting kicking and flinging until he threw him down, but had no hurt. An old woman in the Town called goodwife Clarke being mistrusted and examined before Sir Thomas Boes, confessed that she sent forth this spirit, with command to make the horse throw Mr. Long and break his neck: and being demanded by Sir Thomas Boes what was the reason the Spirit did not perform her commands, she answered because the power of God was above the power of the Devil. But the horse did pine to death for his punishment.

The evidence of said Mr. Long.

He said that one morning as he was walking abroad, a poor woman being of his own Parish spake kindly to him, but his answer was that he and a long time a good opinion of her, although he ever accounted her sister, an ill liver, and little better than those that are accounted Witches, but now he strongly believed that her sister had made her as bad as herself; this much trouble the old woman, and she would not leave following and persuading the said mr. Long to bee of his former good opinion, professing her own innocence of any ill of such nature, or any coompact with such evil Spirit what soever, but finding him not satisfied with any thing she had said, she assured him she would give him an evidence undeniable, whereupon she lifted up both her hands toward heaven, calling God to witness, and desired that he would show a present Judgment upon her if she were not onnocent and clear: now Mr. Long affirmed upon his oath that these words were no sooner out of her mouth, but she was struck to the ground upon her back before his face, where she did lye in a most lamentable condition, trembling and crying; he took her up and carried her into an Alehouse hard by, where she did lie in this extremity two days, and that so soon as she came ot herself he gave her the best comfort he could, showing how merciful God had been to her in sparing her life, giving her time of repentance, the first step whereof must be her confession and contrition, whereupon she confessed that she had done much mischief, and that she had compacted with the Devil, that he usually sucked her and appeared unto her in the shape of a Squirrel.

These aforesaid Witches have confessed that they did raise the great winds in March last, and caused a Hoy to be cast away, wherein were many passengers.

When these witches came ifrst into the Goal at Colchester, the Jailer lost his meat often, and mistrusting that the Witches had got it, upon a time bought a good shoulder of Mutton, and said he would look to the dressing of it himself, but when it was ready the Witches had got it, and all the while the Witches were at supper with it, the Jailer instead of Mutton was eating Hogs-wash.

After this the Jailer desrious to see more of their feats, entreated some of them to show him a little of their cunning, thinking to make himself merry for the loss of his meat, whereupon one of the Witches bid him go fetch her four pewter dishes wherein never water came; straightway went the Jailer to a Pewterer and got 4 new dishes, and before he brought them to the Witch he wet one of them, contrary to the Witches direction, nevertheless as soon as the Witch had them, she put her hands and feet into the four dishes, and upon an instant was lifted into the ayre with three dishes taht were dry, the fourth falling off, and by good chance was found in a meadow about half a mile off, and brought back to Prison.
