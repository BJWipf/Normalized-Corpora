1
[The Sal]isbury assizes. [...]and of witchcraft. Being a true relation of one mistress Bodnan living in Fisherton, next house but one to the gallows, who being [a] Witch seduced a maid, called by name, Anne Stiles, to the same abominable and detested action of witchcraft; which Witch for that action was executed the 19 day of March 1653. To the tune of Bragandary.
When men and women leave the way of God, and goodness quite,
They practice mischief every day, and therein take delight
The Devil then is ny at hand
When these things he doth understand,
You that will go,
High or low
Resolve upon this doubt.

As by the Story you shall hear […]ft you will list a while
The Devil lately did appetite; and a Woman did beguile.
But she did make the way before,
And to her heart did him adore
You that will go, &c.

Sin Fisherton this dame did dwell of conversation bad,
She did converse with the Devil of Hell, which made her friends all sad,
Unto the Devil she gave her soul
Sealed in a bloody scroll,
 You that will go, &c.

Mistress Bodnam was her name, who daily undertake
To help men to [?]oine gods again,
[…] with her conjuring take
A looking glass she had likewise,
To the […] before their eyes
You that will go, &c.

Among the rest a Maid then went,
Her name was Anise Stiles
About [?]olne goods in discontent
But the Devil her beguiles
The Devil did the Witch persuade
For to seduce this silly maid
You that will go, &c

She gave the Maid a Looking glass
On which she looked on
But at the length it came to pas
She was to soon undone,
For want of wisdom and true grace,
She was undone in little space,
You that will go, &e.

Sweet heart quoth she if that you please,
I will teach you my art,
So you may live in wealth and ease
According to your heart.
If you your Soul the Devil will give,
In health and wealth you then may live,
You that will go, &c.

To soon alas she did consent
And sealed it with her blood;
Which made her afterwards repent,
When as she understood
That she must loose the joys of heaven
For some Toys unto her given
You that willl go,
High or low,
Resolve upon this doubt.

2 At length it came for to be known,
How she had simply run
Then to the Witch she made her moan
And said she was undone
She said to London she would fly,
For fear least both of them should dye,
You that will go
High or low,
Resolve upon this doubt.

The Witch was willing there unto,
And bid her fly with speed
She was at Stockbridge taken though,
For that notorious deed,
The Devil cast her to and fro
As all the company did know
You that will go, &c,

When in the chamber she came in,
The Devil tossed her about
She asked the devil where heed bin
To give her a flout,
Then all the standers by amaze’d,
Upon each other then they gaz’d,
You that will go, &c,

A Gentleman great pains did take,
With her the people say,
And she to him her mind did break
And for her he did pray,
She told him the old witch was case
That she had broke Gods holy laws
You that will go, &c.

Four days together she was vert tormented grievously
And in her mind was fore perplex[…]
That some thought she would […]
    Lone[…]

The Devil like a Snake appeared
Which all the country people feared
You that will go, &c,

But then the old Which came in sight,
Then did she take her rest,
And she did sleep well all that night
As plainly is expressed,
She said when as she walked again,
She praised God she felt no pain
You that will go, &tc.

She told the Gentleman that she
Would tell him all her art
And that he should enriched by
By what she should impart
She told him that she knew full well,
She should be a great Lady in hell,
You that will go, &c.

The old Witch executed was,
This month the 19. Day,
She ever had a face of Bliss
As all the people say,
Indeed of pensiveness and prayer
She did nought but curse and swear,
You that will go, &c,

God nothing had to doe with her
She said most desperately
She swore and cursed and kept a […]r
And desperately did dye
Let all good people therefore say
[…] hearts with me and pray,
You that will go, &c.
