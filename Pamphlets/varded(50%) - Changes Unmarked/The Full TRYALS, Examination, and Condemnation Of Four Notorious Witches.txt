An Account of the Trials, and Examination, and Condemnation, of Four Notorious Witches, &c.
SOme Wise Men in all Ages of the World, have been very hardly brought to believe the Account of Extraordinary Relations, especially about Witches and Witch-craft, but it is an open Violence, or at least a manifest injury, to common Sense, to Codemn all Facts, as false because some are so, at this rate all Criminals ought to be Acquitted, because some hve Suffered undeservedly: But that there are, and hath been Witches and Witch-crafts, many Authors have proved at large from Reasons Scripture, Antiquity, and the Expearance of all Nations and Ages The following Narritive coming to my hand i thought it might be acceptable to the Public, Especially since Providence designs those Eminent, Occurrences raider for our Practical instruction than for a Subject of Notional Speculation.

On Saturday March the 5th the Assizes being then at VVorcester, the Trials of Rebecca West, Margaret Landis, Susan Cock, and Rose Hallybread, Four Notorious and Reputed Witches, came on for several Diabolical and abominable Practises, by Witchcraft and Fascination on the Bodies of Children and Cattle, &c. The Court being Sat, Rebecca West was brought to the Bar, when after her Indictment was Read. Iohn Edes was called as an Evidence against her, who Deposed that the said Rekecca West some Weeks a go Confessed to him; that she had familiarity with the Devil, who came to her in the likeness of a young Man, promising her that she should be revenged of all her Enemies, and have what she desired, if she would deny God and wholly trust to him; and that the said Prisoner further told him, that upon requesting

the Devil to revenge her on one Iohn Start who Livd in the same House, he quickly after Sickened and Dyed, so that she then thought he could do as God, and thereupon desired him to join in that Wicked and Devilish Art, Matthew Hopkins, also Deposed that the said Prisoner Confessed to him since in Prison, that the Devil came to her one Night as she was going to Bed, and told her he would Mary her, and that he then kissed her, but was as cold as Clay, and that he took her by the Hand and leading her about the Chamber a turn or two, he said they were Married, and promised to be her Loving Husband, and to avenge her of her Enemies; and that she sent the Devil to Kill the said Iohn Hart, which was done accordingly. Thomas Hart Father of the Deceased Deposed that he verily believed that his Son dyed by Witchcraft, and that during his Torture he heard him cry out against Rebecca West; a Doctor of Physic also spoke to the same Effect, as did several others; Upon which being asked by the Court what she could say for herself, she only alleged that her great Povety had occasioned all this, and pleaded guilty, desiring Mercy, but the Jury after having received their Charge, Immediately brought her in guilty of Murder and Witch-craft.
Then Margaret Landish, was brought to the Bar, and Arraigned for Witch-craft, and Diabolical Sorcery, &c. The first Evidence deposed that about the ••rst of December, as the said prisoner passed by his Door, a Child of his, then pointed at her, saying there goes pig the Witch, upon which the said Margaret turned back and Clapped her Hands in a

Threatening manner, telling her she should Sma〈…〉 it, and that very Night the said Child fell Sick in Raving manner, and dyed within three Weeks after. Another Witness deposed, that the said Child, when in its Violent Fits, would often say that pig the Witch was by her Bed side, making strange Mouths at her. Another Evidence deposed, that she once heard the said Margaret say, that she could not enjoy her Health, if she did not send her Imps to do some Mischief or another, and that her Imps did usually suck two Teats near the privy parts; upon which the said Evidence being asked how she got this Confession from the prisoner, she replied that the said prisoner, did use her Endeavours to Entice her to be a Witch also by telling her that she should want for nothing, and further added that she went with her to a Witches Meeting, where she saw the Devil in the likeness of a tall black Man, at which she was so much affrighted that she never went with her any more. Another young Woman spoke, partly to the same effect, and that she was once with the said Margaret, and other, in Mr. Bargrrans Orchard, consulting and plotting the Child's Ruin; the Child's Doctor also deposed that she dyed of a Distemper, which was more than merely Natural, and that she was under the Torture of some Diabolical Agent: The prisoner in her own defence, said that they were all Malicious people and denied that she had Confessed any thing to the Evidence, insinuating as if they had formerly an old Grudge against her, and thereupon made a strange Howling in the Court, to the great disturbance of the whole Bench. Upon which the Court having explained


and Summed up the Evidence, told the Jury that as they ought to beware of Condemning the Innoccent, puns; if they thought the Credit of the Evidence sufficent in what they had deposed, their Eyes ought not to spare her, adding that the Holy Scripture declares, that we must not suffer a Witch to Live, Especially, when guilty of Murder Tortures, &c. Whereupon the Jury after an Hours Consultation brought her in guilty.
Susan Cock, and Rose Hallybread, was next Arraigned for Sorcery and Witch-craft, in Tormenting and Murdering of Mary Peak, and Iohn Peak, the Children of Obadiah Peak of Preston; The chief Evidence against them were Abraham Chad, and Elin Shearcraft, who deposed that they were present with the prisoners, when they first attempted to Torment the said Children; they being then going to enter into that devilish way of practise, and being asked how they went about such a damnable Action, they both were jointly declaring the whole matter, but the Court caused them to be Examined, apart and Separate from one another, to find whither their Evideece agreed: Whereupon Abraham Chad was Examined and the other Evidence had out of the Court; at which time, he the said, Abraham deposed that, in the House of Susan Cock, the two prisoners having made a great Fire, they made the Shape of the dceased Children in Wax, and putting them both on a Spit, one of prisoners turned it, while the other Stuck pins and needles in their Bellies, Heads, and Eyes, and told him that as them Figuers wasted, the Children would waste and is the Spit wene round, they both Muttered to themselves
strange kind of words, which he did not understand: He also Deposed that several Imps in the shape of Mice ran to and from the Fire, and that the next day he heard his Neighbours discourse, how the Children weae Tormented, with strange Prickings in their Eyes, Belly and Head, and so continued worse, and worse till they Dyed, which was about a Week after. Elin Shearcreft being called in, gave the very same Account, tho something more large and exact: The Father and Mother of the two Children said, that about the same time that the Evidence mentioned, they cried out against the said Witches by Name, and continually made complaints, as if Pins and Needles had been actually thrust into their Bodies, without Intermission for above an Hour together. A Midwife and other Women Deposed in Court that searching the Bodies of the Prisoners, they found several large Teats in the secret Parts of their Bodies: and at the same time asking them, how they came there, they both made Answer, that the Devils Imps had done it. However upon their Trials, they denied each Particular, alleging that they were not

then in their Senses, and seemed both to weep and howl, tho not one Tear could be discovered to fall from their Eyes; many more Witness appeared against them, concerning the Bewitching Mr. Peaks Children, which for brevity sake I am forced to omit; but in fine it appearing on all hands that they had been very base and Notorious Persons, for several Years; and none appearing on their Behalfs. The Court summed up each Circumstance with great care, tenderness, and Moderation, and delivered their Opinions to the Jury, with all the Legal Fairness, and Justice that could be desired, or expected, even from the Witches themselves, desiring God to direct them in their Verdict. However the matte being proved against the Prisoners by unanswerable Demonstration, and undeniable Evidence, as well as Extraordinary Circum,stances, the Jury brought them in both guilty of Witch-craft, Fascination and Murder, and received Sentence to be Burnt at the Stak all Four together.
When being come to the Place of Execution, they made a strange and lamentable


Yeling and Howling, after which they confessed the Crimes, for which they Suffered and also declared how they had Killed abundance of Cattle for several years past, and that it was extreme Pride, Malice and Revenge that caused them to Enter into such a cursed an Hellish League with the Devil, who told them to the last, that he would secure them from Public Punishment, but now to late, they found him a Liar, as he was from the beginning of the Worcester Cock and Landish seemed penitent, desiring all you Women to take Warning by their Devilish Lives, and Shameful Deaths, assuring the Spectators, that as Satan in the first Infancy of the World prevailed on Woman to bring his Hellish attempts to pass, so still strives with that Sex, as the weaker Vessels Work their Distructions; they both said the Lords prayer very Distnctly, but Rebecca West, and Rose Hallybread dyed very Stuburn, and Refractory without any remorse, or seeming Terror of Conscience for their abominable VVitch-craft.
I heartly wish the sad Fates of these Four Notorious and Barbarous Wretches may be a warning to all Malicious, and Revengeful persons whatsoever, least the Devil who sets them on Work, at last pays them the Witches with Eternal Damnation, whieh undoubtedly will be the  portion of all those, who wilfully Engages in the Service of so faithless Master.
