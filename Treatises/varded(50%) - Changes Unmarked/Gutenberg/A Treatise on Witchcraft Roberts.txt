     A Treatise of Witchcraft.

             Wherein sundry Propositions are laid
     down, plainly discovering the wickedness of that
      damnable Art, with diverse other special points
     annexed, not impertinent to the same, such as ought
       diligently of every Christian to be considered.

          With a true Narration of the Witch-crafts
      which Mary Smith, wife of Henry Smith Glover,
   did practise: Of her contract vocally made between the
 Devil and her, in solemn terms, by whose means she hurt
      sundry persons whom she envied: Which is confirmed
  by her own confession, and also from the public Records
     of the Examination of diverse upon their oaths: And
     lastly, of her death and execution, for the same;
          which was on the twelfth day of January
                         last past.

    Counsel, Burgesses and Inhabitants of
          Kings Linne in Norffolke,
                Grace and Peace.


Right Worshipful:

In these last days, and perilous times, among the rest of those
dreadful evils, which are fore-told should abound[a] in them, a close
& disguised contempt of religion may be justly accounted as chief,
which causes and brings upon men all disastrous effects, when
although it be shadowed with a beautiful Mask of holiness, fair
tongued: yet false-harted,[b] professing they know God, but in works
deny him. And among these there be two especial sorts; the one, who
entertaining a stubborn, and curious rash boldness, strive by the
iudgem[~e]t of reason, to search ouer-deeply into the knowledge of those
things which are far above the reach of any humane capacity. And so
making shipwreck in this deep and vnfoundable Sea, overwhelm
themselves in the gulf thereof. The other kind is more sottish, dull,
and of a slow wit, and therefore ouer-credulous, believing every thing,
especially when they be carried by the violent tempest of their desires,
and other ungoverned affections; and among these the devil usually
spreads his nets, as assured of a prey, weighting closely if he can
epsy any, who either grow discontented and desperate, through want and
poverty, or be exasperated with a wrathful and unruly passion of
revenge, or transported by unsatiable love to obtain some thing they
desire; and these he taking advantage, assaulteth with golden and
glorious promises, to perform unto them the wishes of their own
hearts; the drift whereof is (he being as at the first encased in a
subtle Serpents skin) only to enthral and invassall them slaves to
himself. The first of these mentioned, are sly and masked Atheists,
who ouer-shadow their secret impiety, loose and dissolute behaviour with
some outward conformity and show of religion, snatching (as they
think) a sufficient warrantize thereof from those disorders they
observe among men, and therefore posse uncensured, having a civil, but
dissembled carriage. The second be Sorcerers, Wizards, Witches, and the
rest of that rank and kindred: no small multitude swarming now in the
world, yet supposed of many, rather worthy pity then punishment, as
deluded by fantasies, and mis-led, not effecting those harms wherewith
they bee charged, or themselves acknowledge. But considering they be
joined and linked together with Satan in a league (the common and
professed enemy of mankind) and by his help perform many subtle
mischievous actions, and hurtful designs, it is strange that from so
great a smoke arising, they neither descry nor fear some fire. And
therefore, in respect of these, I have at your appointment and request
(for whom I am most willing to bestow my best labours and ever shall be)
penned this small Treatise, occasioned by the detection of a late witch
among you, whose irreligious care, and vnwearied industry, is not to be
defrauded of deserved commendation, and by mature deliberation, and
discreet search, found out her irreligious and impious demeanour, and
also discovered sundry her unnatural and inhumane mischiefs done to
others, whereof being convicted, she was accordingly sentenced, and did
undergo the penalty justly appointed, and due by Law unto malefactors
of that kind. After all which, you kindled with a holy zeal of the
advancement of Gods glory, and giving satisfaction to every one
howsoever affected, intermitted no means, using therein the labour of
your careful Ministers (willingly offering themselves in this holy
service) whereby she might be brought (as one converted in the last
hour) to the sight & acknowledgement of her heinous sins in general,
& particularly of that of witchcraft, confessing the same, & by true
repentance, and embracing of the tender mercies of God in Christ Iesus
save her soul (who refuses no true and unfeigned convert at any time.)
And he graciously blessing these religious endeavours of yours,
vouchsafed to second the same with a happy and wished for event, which
(as I hope) shall appear manifestly in the following Treatise unto all
those who are not fondly, & without cause, too much wedded to their own
conceits: And thus, desiring GOD most humbly to confirm and strengthen
you in his truth, which ever you have loved, and is your due praise, and
shall be at the last an honour unto you: I rest

            Your Worships in all Christian duty
                     to be commanded,

                                      A. ROBERTS.

To the Reader.

Christian Reader, I have upon occasion penned this short discourse, and
that of such a subject wherewith not being well acquainted, am enforced
to crave some direction from those, whose names you shall find
remembered in the same: (that I be not unthankful unto those from whom
I receive instruction) and have in former time, and latter days, taken
pains in searching out, both the speculative, and practique parts of
this damnable Art of Witchcraft, a dangerous and seducing invention of
Satan, who from the Arsenals, and Magisins store-houses of his ancient
and mischievous furniture, hath not spared to afford all help, and the
best Engines for the subverting of souls, pliable to his allurements:
and to this end, beside a plain narration of fact in this case
committed and confessed, (least the Treatise should be too bare and
naked) I have added thereunto a few Propositions, agreeing to such a
subject matter, manifesting some special points not altogether
impertinent in my opinion, nor unworthy of due consideration: I know
mine own wants, and do as willingly acknowledge them: One more
experienced, and of greater leisure, and better health, had been fitter
for the opening and discovering of so deep a mystery, and hidden secret
of Iniquity, as this is; and happily hereafter may be willing to take that
task in hand: yet herein thou shalt find something not usual: A
manifest contract made with the Devil, and by the solemn terms of
a league, which is the ground of all the pernicious actions proceeding
from those sorts of people, who are, have been, and shall be
practioners in that cursed and hellish Art. And yet no more then she,
that Witch of whom in this relation we do speak, hath of her own
accord, and voluntarily acknowledged after conference had with me, and
sundry learned and reverend Divines, who both prayed for her conversion,
carefully instructed her in the way to salvation, and hopefully rescued
her from the Devil, (to whom she was devoted, and by him seduced) and
regained her to God, from whom she was departed by Apostasy. And in
this so Christian and holy action were the continual pains of

            { Thomas Howes.
            { Thomas Hares.
    Master { Iohn Man.
            { William Leedes.
            { Robert Burward.
            { William Armitage.

And of these in the day of execution (which she in no wise would
condescend unto should be deferred, though offered repriuall upon hope
that more might have been acknowledged) being very distemperate,
nevertheless some accompanied her to the place, and were both eye and
eare-witnesses of her behaviour there, seeing and hearing how she did
then particularly confess her confederacy with the Devil, cursing,
banning, and envy towards her neighbours, and hurts done to then,
expressing every one by name, so many as be in the following discourse,
nominated, and how she craved mercy of God, and pardon for her offences,
with other more specialties afterword expressed. And thus I end, taking
my leave, and commending thee to the gracious guidance and preservation
of our good God in our blessed Saviour Christ Iesus.

            Thine ever in the Lord,

                        A. ROBERTS.

                   A TREATISE OF THE
                    CONFESSION AND
               EXECVTION OF MARY SMITH,
               CONVICTED OF WITCHCRAFT,
  and condemned for the same: of her contract vocally
       & in solemn terms made with the Devil;
      by whose means she hurt sundry persons whom
   she envied, with some necessary Propositions added
 thereunto, discovering the wickedness of that damnable
       Art, and divers other special points, not
        impertinent unto the same, such as ought
            diligently of every Christian to
                    bee considered.


There is some diversity of judgment among the learned, who should be
the first Author and Inuenter of Magical and curious Arts. The most
general occurrence of opinion is, that they fetch their pedigree from
the [a]Persians, who searching more deeply into the secrets of Nature
then others, and not contented to bound themselves within the limits
thereof, fell foul of the Devil, and were ensnared in his nets.

    [Footnote a: Augustinus de diuinatione D??monum: & de Ciuitate
    Dei. lib. 7. cap. 35. Plinius historia naturalis lib. 30. cap. 1.]

And among these, the publisher unto the world was Zoroaster, who so
soon as he by birth[b] entered the world, contrary to the usual
condition of other men, laughed (whereas the beginning of our life is a
sob, the end a sigh) and this was ominous to himself, no warrantise for
the enjoying of the pleasures of this life, overcome in battle by
Ninus[c] King of the Assirians, and ending his days by the stroke
of a thunder-bolt, and could not, though a famous Sorcerer, either
fore-see, or prevent his own destiny. And because he writ many books
of this damnable Art, and left them to posterity, may well be accounted
a chief master of the same. But the Devil[d] must have the
precedence, whose scholars both he and the rest were, who followed
treading in his steps. For he taught them South-saying, Auguration,
Necromancy, and the rest, mere delusions, aiming therein at no other
mark, then to with draw men from the true worshipping of God. And all
these pernicious practises are fast tied together by the tails, though
their faces look sundry ways; and therefore the Professors thereof are
stiled by sundry names, as Magicians, Necromancers, Enchanters, Wizards,
Hags, Fortune-tellers, Diuiners, Witches, Cunning Men, and Women, &c.
Whose Art is such a hidden mystery of[e] wickedness, and so
unsearchable a depth of Satan, that neither the secrets of the one can
be discovered, nor the bottom of the other further sounded, then either
the practisers thereof themselves by their own voluntary confessions
made, or procured by order of Justice (according to the manner of that
Country where they be questioned) have acknowledged, or is manifested
by the sundry mischiefs done of them unto others, proved by impartial
testimonies upon oath, and by vehement presumptions confirmed, or else
communicated unto vs in the learned Treatises, and discourses of ancient
and late Writers gathered from the same grounds. And[f] although this
Hellish Art be not now so frequent as heretofore, since the Pagans have
been converted unto Christianity, and the thick fogs of Popery
ouer-mantling the bright shining beams of the Gospel of Iesus Christ
(who came to dissolve the works of the Devil .1. Ioh. 3. 8.) and
were by the sincere and powerful preaching thereof dispersed; yet
considering these bee the last times, days evil & dangerous, fore-told
that should come, 2. Tim. 3. 1. in which iniquity must abound, Mat.
24. 12. and as a raging deluge ouer-runne all, so that Faith shall
scarce be found upon earth, Luck. 18. 8. and the Devil loosed from his
thousand years imprisonment, [g]Revel. 20. 3. enraged with great
wrath walk about, and seeks whom he may devour .1. Pet. 5. 8.
Because he knows he hath but a short time, Reu. 12. 12. Before I
enter into the particularity of the narration intended, it shall be
material to set down some general propositions, as a handful of
gleanings gathered in the plentiful harvest of such learned men, who
have written of this argument, whereby the erroneous may be recalled,
the weak strengthened, the ignorant informed, and such as judge aright
already, confirmed: and among many other these as chief, all which you
shall see exemplified in the following Discourse.

    The first Proposition.


It is a Qu??re, though needless, whether there be any Witches: for
they[a] have some Proctors who plead a nullity in this case, persuade
themselves, and would induce others to be of the same mind, that there
be no Witches at all: but a sort of melancholic, aged, and ignorant
Women, deluded in their imagination; and acknowledge such things to be
effected by them, which are unpossible, unlikely, and they never did;
and therefore Magistrates who inflict any punishment upon them, be
unmerciful and cruel Butchers. Yet by the way, and their good leave,
who take upon them this Apology, all who are convented upon these
unlawful action, are not stricken in years; but some even in the
flower of their youth be nuzzled up in the same, and convicted to
be practisers thereof; neither be they overflowed with a black
melancholic humour, dazzling the fantasy, but have their
understandings clear, and wits as quick as other: Neither yet be they
all women, though for the most part that sex be inclinable thereunto:
(as shall afterword be showed, and the causes thereof) but men also on
whose behalf no exception can be laid, why any should demur either of
their offence or punishment for the same. Wherefore for this point, and
confirmation of the affirmative, wee have sundry pregnant and evident
proofs.

    [Footnote a: Wierus de magor[~u] infamium p[oe]nis lib 6. cap.
    17.18 19 20 21 22 23 24 &. 27. & de Lamijs lib 3. cap 7. & de
    lamiarum impotentia. But this position comes from another as
    dangerous, even Infidelity denying that there be any Devil, but
    in opinion; which was the doctrine of Aristotle, and the
    Peripatetic Philpsophers. Pomponatius de incarnationibus
    Binfeldius de confessionibus maleficorum]

First testimonies Divine and Humane: Divine of God himself in his
word,[b] left for our instruction in all dogmaticall truth, reproof and
confutation of falsehood in opinions, correction for the reforming of
misdemeanours in conversation, doctrine for the guidance of every estate
Political, Ecclesiastical, Economical. 2. Timoth. 3. 16. Therefore
expressly, Thou shalt not suffer a Witch, to live, Exod. 22. 18.[c]
but to bee executed in the same day wherein she is convicted, and this
was a custom observed by the ancient Fathers. And Deuteronomy 18.
10.11. there is a black Bill set down[d], and registered of sundry
kinds of these slaves of Satan, all condemned, and God adds in the
same place the reasons of this his severe and sharpe judgment against
them. First, because they are an abomination unto him. Secondly, he
determines utterly to destroy all such, and gives his people the
Israelites an example thereof in the Canaanites, whom their Land spewed
out. Thirdly, for that he requires all who belong unto him, to be pure,
undefiled and holy, not stained with impieties, for they are bound unto
him by covenant in obedience. Fourthly such were the Heathen, strangers
from God, blinded in their dark understanding, without saving knowledge,
with whom the Israelites, a chosen and peculiar nation, enjoying his
laws and statutes, must have no familiarity. Further, the woman of
Endor acknowledges herself to be one of the rank. 1. Sam. 28. 9.
And Iesabel, mother of Iehoram, is in plain terms stiled a Witch.
2. King. 9. 22. who is [e]supposed to have brought this Art, and the
Professors thereof into Samaria, which there continued for the space
of six hundred years. Insomuch that it was rife in common speech, when
any would reproach another, to doe the same in this form; Thou art a
Samaritan, and hast a Devil (a familiar spirit) which the malicious
Jaws, not abiding his heavenly and gracious doctrine, objected to
Christ Iesus our blessed Saviour, Ioh. 8. 48. The holy Apostle
reproving the Galathians for their sudden Apostasy and back-sliding
from the Gospel so powerfully preached unto them and with so great
evidence of the spirit, as though Christ had bin crucified before their
eyes, doth it in no other terms than these, Who hath bewitched you?
Gal. 3. 1. And afterword, Cap. 5. 20. marshalleth Witch-craft among
the works of the flesh: In both which places the names are taken from
the seducements and illusions of Enchanters, who astonish the minds,
and deceive the senses of men, and all that by virtue of a contract
passed between them and the Devil. Other like proofs may be added to
these alleged, Leuit. 20. 6. Micah 5. 12. Nahum 3. 4. Now then
when God affirms there be such, whose words are truth, shall man dare
once to open his mouth, and contradict the most righteous?

    [Footnote e: Bodinus in confutatione opinionum Wieri.]

Concerning humane witnesses, they be almost infinite; and therefore it
shall be sufficient to produce some few, choice, and selected: [f] The
second Council of Constantinople held and gathered together in the
Imperial palace, of two hundred seven and twenty learned and reverent
Bishops, names sundry sorts of such Sorcerers, and censureth their
actions to be the damned practises of the Pagans, and decrees all the
Agents therein excommunicated from the Church and society of Christian
people, adding the motive reason of this their determined sentence, from
the Apostle, 2. Cor. 6. 14. For righteousness hath no fellowship with
unrighteousness, neither is there communion of light with darkness,
nor concord with Christ and Belial, nor the beleeuer can have part with
an Infidel. And [g]Chrysostome sharply reproves all such, and those
who advise with them upon any occasion, confuting the reasons which they
take to be sufficient warantise of their doings. As among the rest they
will pretend, She was a Christian woman who doth thus charm or
enchant; and takes no other but the name of God in her mouth, uses the
words of sacred Scripture. To this that holy Father replies, Therefore
she is the more to be hated, because she hath abused and taken in vain
that great and glorious name, and professing herself a Christian, yet
practises the [h]damnable Arts of miscreant and vnbeleeuing Heathen.
For the Devils could speak the name of God, and nevertheless were
still Devils; and when they said unto Christ, they knew who he was, the
holy one of God, &c. Mar. 1. 24.25. their mouths were stopped, he
would no such witness, that wee should learn, not to believe them when
they say the truth: for this is but a bait, that wee might afterword
follow their lies. There is much mention made of these, both in the
Civil and [i]Canon Laws, and diversity of punishment allotted out for
them; so that none can doubt but that there hath been, and are such.
I might remember unto you the authority of Clemens Romanus in his
Recognitions, and those Constitutions which are fathered upon the
Apostles; but their credit is not so great, that they may without
exception be impannelled upon this Jury, for they have long since been
challenged of [k]insufficiency.

Among the Gentiles, when these so qualitied persons did swarm, and were
accounted of high esteem, there be reckoned up whole troops of this
black guard of the Devil; As [l]Circa whom Homer reports to have
turned Vlysses Companions into Wolves, Lyons, Swine, &c. by her
Enchantments, insauaging and making them beast-like and furious.
Medea[m] famous in this kind, for she murdered by Witch-craft
Glauca in the day of her marriage, who enjoyed Iason her love.
And[n] the Mortars of these two, wherein they stamped their Magical
drugs, were for a long time kept in a certain mountain, and showed
as strange monuments to those who desired a sight of them. For[o] the
Devil furnishes such with powders, ointments, herbs, and like
receipts, whereby they procure sickness, death, health, or work other
supernatural effects. Of the same profession were [p]Simotha,
[q]Erictho, [r]Canidia, and infinite others beside, whose damnable
memory deserves to be buried in everlasting oblivion.

But because the reports of these may seem to carry small credit, for
that they come from Poets, who are stained with the note of licentious
[s]faining, and so put off as vain fictions; yet seeing they deliver
nothing herein but that which was well known and usual in those times
wherein they lived, they are not slightly, and upon an imagined conceit,
to be rejected: for they affirm no more then is manifest in the records
of most approved Histories, whose essence is and must be [t]truth, [u]as
straightness of a rule, or else deserve not that title. In which wee
read of [x]Martiana, [y]Locusta, [z]Martha, [aa]Pamphilia,
[bb]Aruna, &c. And not to insist upon particulars, there bee
infinite numbers overflowing even in these our[cc] days, since the
sincerity of Christian Profession hath decreased, and been in a sort
eclipsed in the hearts of men: for the period of the continuance
thereof (after it be once embraced) in his first integrity, either for
zeal of affection, or strictness of discipline, hath been by some
learned Divines[dd] observed, to bee confined within the compass of
twenty years; and then afterword by degrees, the one waxed cold, and
the other dissolute: which being so, it is not to be marvelled though
the Devil now begin to show himself in these his instruments, as
heretofore, though he cannot in the same measure, in respect of those
sparks of light which yet shine amongst vs. But of this so much now,
because I shall have afterword occasion further to enlarge this point.

Again, the policy of all States[ee] have provided for the rooting out
of these poysonfull Weeds, and cutting of these rotten and infected
members; and therefore infallibly proving their existence and being: for
all[ff] penal laws look to matters of fact and are made to punish for
the present, and prevent in future, some wicked actions already
committed. And therefore Solon the Athenian making statutes for the
settling of that Common-wealth, when a defect was found, that he omitted
to provide a cautelous restraint, and appoint[gg] answerable
punishm[~e]t for such who had killed their parents, answered, He never
suspected there were or would be any such. Wherefore to confirm the
position set down, God doth not threaten to cast away his people for
murder, incest, tyranny, &c. But Sorcery, Leuit. 20. 6. And Samuel
willing to show Saul the grieuousnesse of his disobedience, compares
it to witch-craft, 1. Sam. 15. 23. The Holy Ghost also manifesting how
highly God was displeased with Manasses, makes this the reason,
because he gave himself to Witch-craft, and to Charming, and to
Sorcery, and used them who had familiar spirits, and did much evil in
the sight of the Lord to anger him, 2. Chro. 33. 6. And for this
offence were the ten tribes of Israel led into captivity, 2. King.
17. 17. [hh]The twelve Tables of the Romans (the ancientest law they
have) by a solemn Embassage (sent for that purpose) obtained from
Athens, & accounted as a Library of knowledge, do both make mention of
such malefactors, & decree a penalty to be inflicted upon them.
[ii]Constantius and Constantinus think them worthy of some unusual
death, as enemies of mankind, strangers from nature: [kk]and Iulius
Paulus distinguishing the punishment according to the different
quality of the offenders, pronounces out of the then received
opinions, that the better sort found guilty, were to dye (not
determining the manner) those of meaner condition either to bee
crucified, or devoured of wilde beasts.

Our ancient Saxon Kings before the [ll]Conquest, have in their
municipal Laws apparently demonstrated what they conceived of these so
dangerous and devilish persons. Alucidus keeps the express words
of God; F[oe]minas sagas no sinite viuere. Suffer not women Witches
to live. Gunthrunus and Canutus will have them, being once
apprehended (that the rest of the people might bee pure and undefiled)
sent into banishment, or if they abide in the kingdom (continuing their
lewd practises) executed according to desert. So Athelstane, if they
be convicted to have killed any, &c. And how the present estate stands
affected toward them, the sundry strict statutes in this case provided,
may give any, not wedded to his own stubbornenesse, sufficient and full
satisfaction. Wherefore not to erect a Tabernacle, and dwell longer in
persuading an undeniable truth, that there bee Sorcerers and Witches, I
leave these Hellish Infidels, and proceed.

    The second Proposition.


The second Proposition: [a]Who those be, and of what quality, that are
thus ensnared of the Devil, and undermined by his frauds. For
resolution whereof, this may suffice. Those who either maliciously
reject the Gospel offered unto them: or receiving and understanding the
same, do but coldly respect, and carelessly taste it, without making any
due estimation, or having any reverent regard thereof. In both which is a
manifest and open contempt of God. For as he purposing to honour the
first coming of his Son into the World, clothed in the cloud of our
flesh, which he assumed then, suffered many to be really possessed of
Devils, to bee lunatic, deaf, dumb, blind, &c. whom he might
deliver from these torments, and so make apparent his glory, and show by
these his miracles wrought, that he was the promised Mossies, Essay 35.
5.6. And therefore Christ referreth those Disciples whom Iohn sent
unto him (doubting in respect of that base form which he took, and
demanding whether it was he that should come, or another to be looked
for) unto his Doctrine and Works; and by them to bee instructed,
whereof they were then both hearers and beholders, Math. 11. 3.4.5. So
now coming in the dew of his grace, and having restored the light of
the Gospel, and bestowed that upon mankind, as an especial and
vnvaluable blessing, in his justice gives over the despisers thereof
unto the power of Satan, whereby both others who contemn the same,
might by their dreadful example bee terrified, and the faithful
stirred up to a respective thankfulness, for so great a mercy
vouchsafed unto them, and acknowledge their happiness in being made
partakers thereof, and by especial favour delivered out of the tyranny
of the Devil: For this is one of the fearful judgements of God, and
hidden from vs (as all are a great depth, Psal. 36. 6.) that those who
received not the truth that they might be saved, should have strong
delusions sent unto them, and bee given over to believe Satan and his
lying signs, and false wonders, 2. Thess. 2. 10. And thus consenting
unto sin, and his suggestions, they are deprived of the [b]help and
assistance of God, and so disabled to resist all violent rushing
temptations: for one offence, not being truly repented of, brings
another, and at last throws head-long down into hell: and by this
means man despising God his creator & redeemer, and obeying the Devil
a professed enemy, and irreconcilable adversary, not easy to be
confronted, becomes his servant: for of whomsoever any is overcome,
even of the same is he brought into bondage, 2. Pet. 2. 19. And the
Apostle gives as the reason why the heathen were so sottish Idolaters,
and defiled themselves with many detestable and loathsome sins,
[c]because when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither
were thankful, therefore God gave them over to a reprobate sense, and
vile affections to doe those things which were not convenient, full of
all unrighteousness, Rome 1. 24.25. &. 29 So these being enthralled,
and deuoting themselves to the Devil by a mutual league (either
express or secret) he brands with his mark for his [d]own, as in
ancient time was an use with Bondslaves and [e]Captives, and these bee
+ez??gr??menoi+, taken alive in his snare, 2. Tim. 2. 26. and
that in some part of the body, least either suspected or perceived by vs
(for he is a cunning concealer) as under the eye-lids, or in the palate
of the mouth, or other secret places: Wherefore some Judges cause them,
once being called into question, and accused, to be shaven all the
body[f] over. And for the manner of impression, or branding, it is after
this sort. The Devil when he hath once made the contract between
himself and the Witch, and agreed upon the conditions, what they shall
doe, the one for the other, gives her some scratch[g], which remains
full of pain & anguish until his return again: at which time he doth
so benumme the same, that though it be pierced with any sharpe
instrument, yet is without any sense of feeling, and will not yield one
drop of blood at all: a matter known by just, often, and due trial.

And for the most part, he brings these his slaves and vassailes
obliged to him as his own, to some desperate, Tragical,[h] and
disastrous end; and that either by the execution of Justice for their
demerits, or by laying violent hands upon themselves, or else God
powers upon them some strange and extraordinary vengeance, or their
Grand-maister whom they have served, dispatches them in such manner, as
they become dreadful and terrible spectacles to the beholders, whereof
Histories will furnish vs with [i]variety and plenty of examples: For
the Devil is a murdering spirit, desirous to doe mischief, swelling
in pride, malicious in hatred, spiteful in envy, subtle in craft; and
therefore it behooves every one resolutely to withstand his assaults,
Ephes. 4. 27. and cautelously to decline his subtleties, and cunning
ambushments [Sidenote: +methodeiai+] from whence he inuadeth vs, Eph.
6. 11.[k] For this adversary against whom we fight, is an old beaten
enemy, six thousand years are fully complete since the first time he
began to assault mankind. But if any keep the Commandments of God,
and constantly, by a lively faith, cleave fast unto Christ, he shall
overcome: for our Lord is invincible.[l] The Devils indeed doe willingly
offer themselves to be seen of those who are not governed by the Holy
Ghost; and that either to win themselves some estimation, or to entangle
and deceive men, veiling their treacheries under a smiling countenance,
whom they deadly hate, for if it lay in their possibility, they would
overthrow and destroy heaven it self. Now unable to do this, they
endeavour to work upon a more weak subject and matter; and therefore
he that will not bee subdued of them, must avoid all occasions whereby
he may take any advantage, and covered with the Breast-plate of
Righteousness, and defended with the Shield of Faith, quench all his
fiery Darts. Ephes. 6. 14.

    The third Proposition.


Except God do by his especial grace and ouerruling power, restrain the
malice of these Witches and preserve his Children, they are permissiuely
able,[a] through the help of the Devil their master, to hurt Men and
Beasts, and trouble the elements, by virtue of that contract & agreement
which they have made with him. For man they damage both in body &
mind: In body, for [b]Daneus reports of his own knowledge, as an
eye-witnesse thereof, that he hath seen the breasts of Nurses (only
touched by their hands) those sacred fountains of humane nourishment so
dried up that they could yield no milk; some suddenly tormented with
extreme and intolerable pain of the Colic, others[c] oppressed with
the Palsy, Leprosy, Gout, Apoplexy, &c. And thus disabled from the
performance of any action, many tortured with lingering consumptions,[d]
and not a few afflicted with such diseases, which neither they
themselves who wrought that evil, could afterword help; nor be cured
thereof by the Art and diligent attendance of most skilful Physicians.
I willingly let posse other mischiefs wrought by them, of which many
things are delivered in the Canon and Civil Laws, in the Schoolmen,
and Divines both ancient and modern.

In mind, stirring up men to lust, to hatred, to love, and the like[e]
passions, and that by altering the inward and outward senses, either in
forming some new object, or offering the same to the eye or ear, or
stirring the humours: for there being a near conjunction between the
sensitive and rational faculties of the soul, if the one bee affected,
the other (though indirectly) must of necessity be also moved. As for
example, when they would provoke any to love or hatred, they propound an
object under the show and appearance of that which is good and
beautiful, so that it may be desired and embraced: or else by
representation of that which is evil & infamous, procure dislike and
detestation. Neither is this any strange position, or improbable, but
may bee warranted by sufficient authority; and therefore
[f]Constantius the Emperor doth expressly determine, all those
justly punishable who solicit by enchantments chaste minds to
uncleanness: And Saint [g]Ierome attributeth unto them this power,
that they can enforce men to hate those things they should love, and
affect that which they ought to avoid: and the ground hereof hath his
strength from the holy Scriptures: for the Devil is able to inflame
wanton[h] lust in the heart, and therefore is named, the Spirit of
Fornication, Osea 4. 12. and unclean, Math. 12. 43.

There is a very remarkable example mentioned by Ierome[i], of a
maiden in Gaza whom a young man loving, and not obtaining, went to
Memphis in Egypt, and at the years end in his return, being there
instructed by a Priest of Aesculapius, and furnished with Magical
Conjurations, graved in a plate of brass, strange charming words, and
pictures which he buried under the threshold of the door where the
virgin dwelt: by which means she fell into a fury, pulled off the
attire of her head, flung about her hair, gnashed with her teeth, and
continually called upon the name of her lover.

    [Footnote i: In vita Hilarionis.]

The like doth [k]Nazianzene report of Cyprian before his conversion
(though some think it [l]was not he whose learned and religions
writings are extant, and for the profession of his faith and doctrine
was crowned with Martyrdom) but another of that name, toward Iustina,
whom he lasciviously[m] courted, and unlawfully lusted after. It were
easy for me to instance this in many, and to add more testimonies, but
my intended purpose was, to set down only some few propositions,
whereby the judicious reader might be stirred up to a deeper search, and
further consideration of these things: for often they drive men to a
madness, and other such desperate passions, that they become murderers
of themselves. But this always must be kept in mind, as a granted and
infallible truth, [n]That whatsoever the Witch doth, it receives his
force from that society which she hath with the Devil, who serves her
turn in effecting what she purposes, and so they work together as
[o]associates.

Now concerning beasts they doe oftentimes kill them out-right, and that
in sundry manner, or pine and waste them by little and little, till they
be consumed.

For [p]the Elements, it is an agreeing consent of all, that they can
corrupt and infect them, procure tempests, to stir up thunder &
lightning, move violent winds, destroy the fruits of the earth: for God
hath a thousand ways to chasten disobedient man, and whole treasures
full of vengeance by his Angels, Devils, Men, Beasts. For the whole
nature of things is ready to revenge the wrong done unto the creator.

It were but fruitless labour, and ill spent, to bestow long time in
confirming this so manifest a truth, and not much better then set up a
candle to give the Sunnelight when it shines brightest in mid-heauen:
yet to satisfy those who doubt here-of, I will give a small touch of an
example or two.

[q]Curius Sidius the Roman General in a battle against Salebus,
Captain of the Moors, in want of water, obtained such abundance of
rain from Heaven by Magical enchantments, that it not only sufficed
the thirst of his distressed Soldiers, but terrified the enemies in
such sort, (supposing that God had sent help) as of their own accord,
they sought for conditions of peace, and left the field.

    [Footnote q: Dion. Cassius Romana Histori??, lib. 60. in Claudio.]

The narration of Olaus[r] Magnus which he makes of his Northern
Wizards and Witches, would seem to be mere fictions, and altogether
incredible, as of Ericus, who had the wind at command, to blow
always from that quarter to which he would set his hat. Or Hagbert,
who could show herself in any shape, higher or lower, as she pleased,
at one time so great as a Giant, at another as little as a Dwarf: by
whose Diabolical practises mighty Armies have been dicomfited, and
sundry others, except the truth hereof were without contradiction
approved: by the experience of our own Navigators, who trade in
Finland, Denmark, Lapland, Ward-house, Norway, and other
Countries of that Climate, and have obtained of the inhabitants thereof,
a certain wind for twenty days together, or the like fixed period of
time, according to the distance of place and strings tied with three
knots, so that if one were loosed, they should have a pleasant gale: if
the second, a more vehement blast: if the third, such hideous & raging
tempests that the Mariners were not able once to look out, to stand
upon the hatches, to handle their tackle, or to guide the helm with all
their strength; and are sometimes violently carried back to the place
from whence they first loosed to sea; and many (more hardy then wise)
have bought their trial full dear, opening those knots, and neglecting
admonition given to the contrary. Apuleius ascribeth to Pamphile, a
Witch of Thessalia, little less then divine power to effect strange
wonders in heaven, in earth, in hell; to darken the stars, stay the
course of rivers, dissolve mountains, and raise up spirits, this opinion
went for currant and uncontrolled. And without all question the
Devil[s] can do this and much more, when God lets him loose. For he
is stiled, The Prince of the world, Ioh. 12. 31. A strong man
armed, Luke 11. 21, Principality, a ruler of darkness,
spiritual wickedness in high places, Ephes. 6. 12.

Thus he dismayed the heart of Saul (when he had broken the

betray his master, despair and hang himself, Math. 27. 3. filled
the heart of Ananias and Saphira with dissimulation,Act. 5. 3.
possessed the bodies of many really, as is manifest in the History of
the Gospel. Our Saviour Christ assures vs, that a daughter of
Abraham was bound for 18 years by Satan, with such a spirit of
infirmity, as bowed together, she could in no wise lift up herself,
Luck. 13. 11.16. He spake out of the Pythonesse, Act. 16. 17.
brought down fire from heaven, and consumed Iobs sheep 7000. and his
servants, raised a storm, struck the house wherein his sons and
daughters feasted with their elder brother, smote the four corners of
it, with the ruin whereof they all were destroyed, and perished: and
overspread the body of that holy Saint their father with botches[t] and
biles from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.[u] And he
will have his servants Wizards & Witches, coadiutors with him, and makes
them fit instruments to the performance of all wicked exploits, and this
is when God pleases (of which I shall have occasion to speak more
afterword) to give leave, for his will is the first supreme and principal
cause of all things: and nothing can be done visibly in this
Common-wealth here below of the creatures, but is decreed and determined
so to be first in the high Court of Heaven, according to his
unsearchable wisdom and justice, disposing punishments and rewards as
seems good unto himself. So Pharaohs[x] Magicians could turn water
into blood, their rods into serpents, produce frogs, &c. But when it
came to the base vermin, to make lice, they were puzzled, and
acknowledged their imbecility, confessing, Digitus Dei est,[u] Gods
finger is here, Exod. 18. 19. For if they could effect and bring to
posse all mischievous designments without his sufferance, it would
infer a weakness, and conclude a defect of[z] power in him, as not
sufficient to oppose their strength, supplant their force, and avoid
their stratagems. And we must not imagine that the practioners of these
damnable Arts of which sex soever, be they men or women, do perform
those mischiefs which they effect, by their own skills or such means
as they use, of which sort bee the bones of dead men's skulls, Toads,
Characters, Images, &c. But through the cooperation of the Devil, who
is by nature subtle, by long experience instructed, swift to produces
strange works, & to humane understanding admirable. Yet[aa] he will have
those his vassals persuaded of some great benefit bestowed upon them,
whereby they are enabled to help and hurt, whom, how, and when they
list; and all to indeere them, & by making them partakers in his
villainy, being strongly bound in his service, & steadfastly continued in
the same, might more grievously offend God, and bring just condemnation
upon themselves. And for the greater, and more forcibly enticing
allurement hereunto, he promises to give and doe many things for their
sakes, and reveal to them hidden secrets, and future events, such[bb]
as he himself purposes to doe, or knows by natural signs shall
come to posse. So then to conclude, in[cc] every Magical action, there
must be a concurrence of these three. First, the permitting will of God.
Secondly, the suggestion of the Devil, and his power cooperating.
Thirdly, the desire and consent of the Sorcerer; and if[dd] any of these
be wanting, no trick of witch-craft can be performed. For if God did not
suffer it, neither the Devil, nor the Witch could prevail to do any
thing, no not so much as to hurt one[ee] bristle of a Swine. And if the
Devil had not seduced the mind of the wicked woman, no such matter
would have been attempted. And again, if he had not the Witch to bee
his instrument, the Devil were debarred of his purpose.

And as these evil spirits are in themselves different in power,
understanding, and subtlety: so can their servants do more or less
through their means.

I conclude with that memorable speech of a most noble and learned
man,[ff] The Devil is the Author and principal of all that evil which
the Witch or Wizard commits, not thereby to make them more powerful,
but to deceive them by credulity and ouer-light belief, and to get
himself a companion of his impiety, cruelty, and hatred, which he
bears both to God and man; and also of eternal damnation: for indeed
it is his work, which the foolish and doting wizards conjecture is
brought to posse by the words and enchantments which they utter: and is
very busy thus to colour his proceedings, which never come abroad in
their own likeness, because he envies the blessed estate of man, and
his eternal salvation purchased by the perfect obedience of Christ the
Redeemer, and hates that Image of God which he beholds in him; much
like the Panther,[gg] who when he cannot get hold of the man himself,
is so inflamed with rage, that he tears his picture in pieces
violently which is cast upon the ground to hinder his pursuit of the
hunter who hath carried away his whelps. And [hh]so as Lactantius
speaks, these unclean spirits cast from heaven, wander up and down
the earth, compass land and sea, seeking to bring men to destruction as
a consort of their own desperate and irrecoverable estate.

    The fourth Proposition.


Having showed before, that the precise of Witches receives the being
and perfection from that[a] agreement which is made between them and
Devil, it now follows necessarily, that we do enquire whether it bee
possible that there may be any such agreement and league between them.
The cause of doubt arises from the diversity or disparity of their
natures, the one being a corporal substance, the other spiritual, upon
which ground some[b] have supposed that no such contract can posse: But
we are to hold the contrary affirmative, both de esse, and de posse,
that there may be, and is, notwithstanding this difference of essence, a
mutual contract of the one with the other: for we read of sundry
leagues between God & his people, and some with great solemnity of
ceremonies used in the same, a[c] Genesis 15. 9.17. and Deuteronomy. 5. 2.
and in many other like places, yet is he a simple essence,[d] free from
all division, multiplication, composition, accidents, incorporeal,
spiritual, and invisible. But in Angelical creatures, though there be
no Physical composition of matter and form, or a soul and a body; yet
is there a metaphysical, being substances consisting of an act and
possibility, subject and accidents. And furthcr, between a spirit and a
man, there is communication of the understanding and will, the faculties
and actions whereof must concur in every covenant, which is nothing
else but the consent of two or more persons about the thing.

    [Footnote a: Nauarrus in Manuali confessarior. cap. 11 in primum
    decalogi pr??ceptum.]

    [Footnote b: Ioh. Wierus, totum hoc fictitium putat & fondus
    imaginarimum, & impossibile putat, idque passim in suis libris

    [Footnote c: De his ceremonijs simili??, Ier. cap. 34. 18. & multa
    Cyrillus contra Iulianum & Procopius Gaz??us in hunc locum &
    Augustinus.]

    [Footnote d: Palanus Syntagmatis Theologie, l. 2. cap. 8.]

And when the Devil durst in express terms tender a contract to our
blessed Saviour, tempting him in the wilderness, showing him the
kingdoms of the world, and the glory thereof, offered them with this
condition, All these will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and
worship me, Mat. 4. 9. How much more then will he adventure upon
man, weak, wicked, and easy to be seduced? And who[e] can doubt but
that these bee the solemn and formal words of a bargain, Do vt des,
do vt facias, I give this for to have that given, I bestow this, to
have such, or such a thing done for me.

    [Footnote e: Brissonius de formulis, lib. 6. Solemnia pactorum
    sine obligatione verba sunt: spondes? spondeo. promittis? promitto
    dabis? dabo vt facias, faciam. Iustinianus in institutionibus,
    lib. 3. titulo 16.]

Now this covenant is of two sorts, secret or manifest; secret, when one
indeuoureth or intends to do any thing by such means, which neither
in nature, nor by institution have power to produce the purposed
effects, or be conjoined as neccessary with other, which can bring the
same to posse. Express, wherein consent is given either by writing, and
words, or making such signs, whereby they renounce God, and devote
themselves slaves and vassals unto the Devil, he promising, that upon
such condition they shall doe wonders, know future events, help and
hurt at their pleasure, and others like unto these.

An example whereof wee may observe in[f] Siluester the second, one of
the holy Fathers of Rome, who did homage to the Devil his Lord, and
made fidelity to live at his will and appointment, upon condition to
obtain what he desired, by which means he got first the Bishopric of
Rhemes, after of Rauenna, and at the last the Papacy of Rome.
Which Sea, though it will yield good plenty of such like presidents, and
we may find them in authentical records of Histories, yet I content my
self with this one.

    [Footnote f: Hic Monachus Floriacensis C??nobij diabolo suadente,
    & enormiter instigante si eius ob*quijs & arti magica obligauit

    pontificum actis in lib. 5. in Syluestro secundo, & Robertum
    Barnes. de vitis pontificum Romanorum.]

[g]The formal terms of this covenant, as they bee set down by some,
are most dreadful: and the several points these.

    [Footnote g: Godelmannus de magia tacita & illicita, lib. 1. cap.
    2. x??.8.9.10 &c.]

To renounce God his Creator, and that promise made in Baptism.

To deny Iesus Christ, and refuse the benefits of his obedience, yea to
blaspheme his glorious and holy name.

To worship the Devil, & repose all confidence and trust in him.

To execute his commandments.

To use things created of God for no end, but to the hurt and destruction
of others.

And lastly, to give himself soul and body to that deceitful and
infernal spirit, who on the other part appears to them in the shape
of a man (which is most common) or some other creature, confers
familiarly, and binds himself by many promises, that at all times
called for, he will presently come, give counsel, further their
desires, answer any demand, deliver from prison, and out of all
dangers, bestow riches, wealth, pleasure, and what not? and all without
any labour and paines-taking, in a word to become serviceable to their
will, & accomplish all their requests. And this is that which the
Prophet Essay speaks, chap. 28. 15. to make a covenant with death,
and an agreement with hell. The consent of the ancient Fathers, if there
were any doubt, might be added to the further clearing of this
conclusion. For [h]Cyprian directly affirms, that all those who use
magical Arts, make a covenant with the Devil, yea he himself, while
he practised the same (before his calling to the light and true
knowledge of God) was bound unto him by an especial[i] writing,
whereunto some subscribe with their own blood, which was a use among
divers nations, and a most sure bond of constant friendship, and
[k]inviolable consociation. But herein these seduced wretches are
deceived: for these promises which he makes, are treacherous, and the
obseruances whereunto he enjoins and persuades them, as powerful in
producing such or such effects, mere deceipts, and have no quality in
them to that purpose, but respects his own ends, which are one of
these four.

First, to the moving of them to the breaking of Gods law.

Secondly, to adore him with divine worship and sacred rites.

Thirdly, to weaken their hope and faith in God.

Fourthly, to cover his own fraud and treachery, that it may not be
perceived.

And when they find this Impostor failing in the performance of his
vowed promises, then he wants not his shifts: as that these defects
are not to be imputed to him, or the weakness of the Art, but their
own negligence or ignorance, who have not exactly observed such
directions, and in that manner they were delivered: or mistook his
meaning, which is commonly delivered in[l] ambiguous terms, such as
will admit a double construction: and herein appears the lamentable
and woeful blindness of man, who is contented to swallow up, and
excuse many of his lies by one truth fore-told; which hath casually come
to posse, whereas in other matters they make light account of, yea
c??temne infinite truths, if they shall find by long search and diligent
inquiry, but one falsehood. Wherefore it behooves vs to be careful
Sentinels over our selves, for that our grand[m] adversary, proud,
envious, and not standing in the truth, reposes all his possibility of
victory in lies, and out of this poisoned sink, devises all kind of
deceits, that so he might deprive man of that happy and blessed estate
which he lost by pride, and draw him into the society of his own
damnation: therefore it is a needful caveat given by one of the ancient
Fathers: Our enemy is old against whom wee fight, six [n]thousand
years fully complete are passed since he began to oppose himself
against vs; but if wee observe the commandments of God, and continue
steadfast in faith, apprehending Iesus Christ, then shall we be able to
withstand all his violent assaults, and ouer-come him because Christ in
whom we trust, is invincible.

    [Footnote l: As that to Pope Siluester the second, his demand;
    who asked how long he should liue and enioy the Popedome?
    answered, vntil hee should say masse in Ierusalem; and not long
    after, celebrating the same in a Chappell of the Church
    dedicated to the holy Crosse in Rome, called Ierusalem, knew
    how he was ouer-reached, for there hee dyed. And an other paralell
    to this, may be that of a certaine Bishop, much addicted to these
    vanities, hauing many enemies, and fearing them, asked the Diuell
    whether he should fly or not: who answered, Non, sta secure,
    venient inimici tui suauiter, & subdentur tibi. But being
    surprized, and taken by his aduersaries, and his castle set on
    fire, expostulating with him that hee had deceiued him in his
    distresse, returned answere, that he said true, if his speech had
    been rightly vnderstood: for he aduised, Non sta secure [id est
    fugias] venient inimici tui suauiter, & subdentur, [id est
    ignem tibi]. Such were the Oracles which he gave, and whereof
    all histories do testify. Holcot upon the book of Wisdom,
    and the rest before mentioned with him.]

    The fifth Proposition.


The Devil can assume to himself[a] a body, and frame a voice to speak
with, and further instruct and give satisfaction to those who have
submitted themselves unto him, and are bound to his service. For he lost
not by his transgression and fall, his natural[b] endowments, but they
continued in him whole[c] and perfect, as in the good Angels, who abide
in that obedience and holiness wherein they were created, from whence a
reason confirmatiue may bee thus framed, Good Angels can take unto
themselves bodies, as Genes. 18. 2. Judge. 13. 3.6. therefore the
evil also. Thus the Devil hath appeared to some in the form of a
[d]Man, clothed in purple, & wearing a crown upon his head: to others
in the likeness of a [e]Child: sometime he shows himself in the
form of foure-footed beasts, fowls, creeping things, [f]roaring as a
Lyon, skipping like a Goat, barking after the manner of a dog, and the
like. But[g] it is observed by some, that he cannot take the shape of a
Sheep, or Dove, though of an Angel of light: 2. Cor. 11. 14. And
further, [h]most of the learned doe hold, that those bodies wherein they
doe appear, are fashioned of the[i] air, (though it is not to be
denied, but they can enter into other, as the Devil did into the
Serpent, deceiving Eve, Gen. 3. 1.) which if it continuing pure and
in the own nature,[k] hath neither colour nor figure, yet condensed
receives both, as wee may behold in the clouds, which resemble sometime
one, sometime another shape, and so in them is seen the representation
of Armies fighting, of beasts and Birds, houses, Cities, and sundry
other kinds of apparitions.

Histories of all can witness of the Devils appearance in human[l]
shape: thus a Pseudo-Moses, or Mossies in Crete, persuaded the
Jaws that it was he who brought their Fathers the Israelites out of
Egypt, and led them through the Red Sea, and would conduct them also out
of that land upon the waters into Iudea. But many following his
counsel, perished: the rest admonished by that destruction, turned
back, accusing their folly; and when they made enquiry for this guide,
to have rewarded him according to his desert, was no where to be found,
whereof they conceived he was a Devil in Mans likeness. And such an
one [m]was that merry (but malicious) spirit, who walked for a long time
in Saxony, and was very serviceable, clothed in country apparel, with
a cap on his head, delighted to converse and talk with the people, to
demand questions, and answer what he was asked, hurting none, except
injured before, and then declared himself a right devil in revenge.

    [Footnote l: Socrates Histori[e,] ecclesiast. lib. 7. cap. 38. &
    history Tripar. lib. 12. cap. 9.]

    [Footnote m: Chronicon Hirsangiense.]

[n]The late Discoveries and Nauigations made into the west Indies, can
furnish vs with abundant testimonies hereof, in which the minds of the
inhabitants are both terrified & their bodies massacred by his visible
sight, and cruel tortures; yet (which is the opinion of many learned)
he cannot so perfectly represent the fashion of a mans body, but that
there is some sensible deformity, by which he bewrays himself; as
his [o]feet like those of an Ox, a Horse, or some other beasts, cloven
hoved, his hands crooked, armed with claws, or talents like a vulture:
or some one misshapen part, wherein (though he delight in the shape of
man, as most fitting for company and conference) is demonstrated, the
great and tender love of God toward vs, who hath so branded this
deceiver, that he may bee discerned even of those who are but of mean
capacity, and so consequently avoided. And as in his body assumed, so in
his speech there is a defect, for it is weak, small, whispering,
imperfect.

    lectionum lib. 29. cap. 5. est exemplum dignum admiration.]

    And thus it is [p]reported of Hermolaus Barbarus, who inquiring
    of a
    spirit, the signification and meaning of a difficult [q]word in
    Aristotle, he hard a low hissing, and murmuring voice giving
    answer.

    [Footnote q: +entelecheia+]

And this he doth of set purpose, that so his sophistical & doubtful
words might be the less perceived.

Neither can this seem strange to any, that the Devil should speak,
who brought a voice from Trees to salute[r] Apollonius, and inspired
that talkative Oak in Dodona, famous for the Oracles uttered there in
Heroical verse, to the Gracious, and to every nation in his own
language, Chaldeans, Egyptians, Armenians, and other people who were led
by him, and depended upon his resolution.

    [Footnote r: Philostratus de vita Apollonius lib. 6. cap. 13.]

And thus the [s]Image of Memnon, when the Sun did shine upon it, and
his beams touched the lips thereof, (which was at the arising in the
East) speak unto them who were present.

    [Footnote s: Sophocles in Trachinijs vocat +drun polugl??sson+,

And considering, as hath been mentioned before, that there passes
between the Witch and her Devil, a compact, as with a Master and a
Servant, it must therefore consist upon prescript terms of
commanding, and obeying; and then of necessity is required a conversing
together; and conference whereby the same covenant may be ratified.




    The sixth Proposition.


God gives, both the devil, and his servants the witches, power
sometimes to trouble his own children; so [a]Christ our blessed
Saviour, was by Satan carried from place to place, Math. 4. 5.
Iob[b] in strange manner afflicted, and his children slain, through
his power, whom none can conceive but were Gods servants, religiously
brought up in his fear: and their father hath an honourable testimony
from the mouth of God himself, Iob 1. ver. 8. Dauid, a man
according to Gods own heart, Acts 13. 22. is by Satan stirred up to
number the people, 1. Chron. 21. 1. and that incuriosity and the pride
of his heart, only to know the multitude of his subjects, 2. Sam.
24. 2.

    [Footnote a: Iaquerius in flagello hereticorum fascinariorum,
    cap. 19 & 20.]

    [Footnote b: Binfeldius de confessionibus maleficorum.]

Whereas the Law appoints another end, Exod. 30. 12. which he had
[c]now forgotten, the maintenance of the Ministry and worship of
God. And a daughter of Abraham is bound of the devil eighteen whole
years, had a spirit of Infirmity, was bowed together, and could in no
wise lift up herself, Lu. 13. 11.16. a grievous calamity in respect
of the author, the continuance, and the effect. But to handle this point
a little more distinctly; It shall not be amiss to open first some
reasons, why God doth give this power to the devil over the righteous
his children sometimes, as also upon the wicked and disobedient to his
will: And in the second place, why Witches have the like leave granted
unto them. Therefore for his children.

    [Footnote c: Iosephus +archaiologias+ lib. 7. sectione siue
    capite iuxta Gr??cam editionem 10.]

The first reason of his permission is his inscrutable[d] wisdom, who
out of evil brings good; so Paul had a minister of Satan to buffet
him, to keep him in humility, that he might not wax proud and
high-minded, in regard of those great mysteries which were revealed when
he was taken into the third heaven, 2. Corint. 12. 4. Thus his
tentation was a medicine preservative preventing the disease of his
soul, which otherwise he might have fallen into, [e]for both himself,
and the rest of the Apostles, though they were chosen vessels, yet were
they also frail and brittle, wandering yet in the flesh upon earth, not
triumphing securely in heaven.

    [Footnote d: Zanchius de operibus creationis, part. 1. lib. 4.
    cap. 13. apud quem etiam plura inuenies. Tertul. de fuga in

    probationis conceditur diabolo vis tentationis prouocato, vel
    prouocanti, aut ex causa reprobationis traditur ei peccator aut ex
    causa cohibitionis, vt Apostolus refert sibi datum angelum
    Satan??.]

    [Footnote e: Beda in collectaneis ex Augustino ad Epistolas
    Pauli.]

Second, It is[f] proceeding from his mercy and goodness, for the trial of
faith, obedience and constancy in such as belong to God: whereof there
is an excellent pattern, and unparalleled in Iob 1. 13.14. &c. for by
this trial is made a proof to examine whether wee doe continue firm
upon our square, and unshaken, or no; and be not removed, either by the
[g]seeming wonders of the devil, or of his servants and associates. And
therefore the Apostle pronounces him blessed, who endures temptation,
for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life, which the
Lord hath promised to them that love him, Iames 1. 12. for he is
faithful, and will not suffer vs to be tempted above that we are able,
but with the temptation also make a way to escape, &c. 1. Cor. 10. 13.

Third, Wee are admonished always to stand in a readiness, and be armed
for to fight, prepared to withstand the devil, knowing that God doth
oftentimes give him leave to assault vs. Therefore we have need to be
furnished in all points, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
darkness of this world, against spiritual wickednesses in high
places, Ephes. 6. 11.12. And 1. Pet. 5. 8.9. be sober and vigilant,
because your adversary the devil as a roaring Lyon walk about,
seeking whom he may devour. He [h]is no weak assailant, and therefore
here by the Apostle are noted in him four things: First, his power (a
Lyon): Second, his hatred, and wrath in the word (roaring): Third, his
subtlety (walking about) observing every opportunity and occasion to hurt
vs: Fourth, his cruelty (devour) no contentment but in our ruin and
utter destruction.

    [Footnote h: Strigelius in explicatione locorum Theologicorum
    Melanthonis parte 3. titulo de cruce & calamitatibus.]

Fourth, God would have vs get the victory against Satan, and take
knowledge, that Christ on our side fights for vs, through whom we
triumph, and so are made more undoubtedly assured of our salvation; and
this is that which he promised, The [i]Seed of the woman shall bruise
the head of the Serpent, Gen. 3. 15. And the Apostle confirms, God
shall tread down Satan under your feet, Rome. 16. 20.

    [Footnote i: Augustinus de Genesi ad literam, l. 11. c. 22.]

God suffers the devil to prevail against the wicked, yet in the most
Holy there is no injustice 2. Chron. 19. 7. But First, [k]Herein is
the declaration of his justice, whereby he punishes obstinate sinners,
& those who provoke him to wrath, and will not repent: And thus it is
said of the Egyptians, whom no plagues could soften, that he cast
upon them the fierceness of his anger, and indignation, and trouble, by
sending evil Angels among them, [l]Psalm 78. 49. And when Saul had
neglected the commandment of God, an evil spirit from the Lord
troubled him, 1. Sam. 16. 14. Thus Ahab seduced by his false
prophets descends into the battle, and is slain (contemning the
words of Michaiah) in[m] whose mouths the devil was a lying spirit,

Second, By affliction in the body or goods, God[n] would quicken them
up to seek the salvation of their souls. And so Paul gave over a
scandalous and incestuous person unto the devil, that he might be
induced to forsake his sin, live chastely hereafter, and be an edifying
example to those whom he had offended: and this kind of discipline was
more sovereign, then any other could have been, because mans nature
abhors Satan, and trembles with fear once to conceive that he
should fall into his power and hands, and this is that which he writes,
advising the Corinthians to deliver him unto Satan, for the destruction
of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Iesus,
1. Cor 5. 5. And in this sort he speaks of two other deceivers and
blasphemers, Hymenaus and Alexander, I have delivered them unto
Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme, 1. Timothy 1. 20.
therefore this giving over, was not to destruction, but for correction.

    [Footnote n: Idem cap. 21.]

The last point propounded, was, That witches have power granted to vex
Gods own children as well as others, and prevail over them; and that we
doe enquire (so far as we may, and is iustifiable) of the causes
thereof, which may be these.

First, [o]This is permitted unto them for the experience of their faith
and integrity, so that by this means their love towards God which lay
hidden in the heart, is now made manifest. To be quiet and patient in
prosperity, when we may enjoy benefits at our own pleasure, is a
matter easily to be performed: But to endure the fire of Tribulation,
that is the proof of a steadfast Christian, and in losses and sickness
procured by such to bee silent, and submit our selves, this is the note
of a faithful man, & to choose rather obeying the law of God, to bear
the infirmity of the body, then to ouer-flow in riches, and enjoying
health and strength offend the Lord.

    [Footnote o: Trithemius in libel. 8 qu[e,]stionum quas illi
    dissoluendas proposuit Maximilianus Imperator, qu[e,]st 7.]

Second, this makes a difference between the wicked and the godly: for
thus the holy Apostle speaks of the righteous, that by many
afflictions they must enter into the kingdom of heaven, Act. 14. 22.
And all that will live godly in Christ Iesus suffer tribulations, 2.
Timoth. 3. 12. for whom the Lord loves, he doth chasten, Prouer. 3.
12. It is a Christians glory to undergo for Gods cause, any vexation
whatsoever, whether wrought by the devil, or brought to posse by wicked
men his [p]instruments; for when he is tried, he shall receive the
crown of life, which God hath promised to those who love him, Iames 1.
12. But wee read contrary of the wicked, they become old, yea, are
mighty in power, their seed is established in their sight with them,
and their of-spring before their eyes, their houses are safe from fear,
neither is the rod of God upon them, &c. they spend their days in
wealth, and in a moment go down into the grave, Iob 21. 7.8.9. &c.
Yet surely they are set in slippery places, suddenly destroyed and
perished, & horribly consumed as a dream when one awakes: O Lord, thou
shalt make their Image despised, &c. Psal. 73. 18.19.20.

    The seventh Proposition.


More women in a far different proportion prove Witches then men, by a
hundred to one; therefore the Law of God notes that Sex, as more
subject to that sin, Exodus 22. 18. It is a common speech amongst
the Jewish Rabbis, [a]many women, many Witches: And it should seem
that this was a generally received opinion, for so it is noted by
Pliny, Quintilian, and others, neither doth this proceed (as some
have thought) from their frailty and imbecility, for in many of them
there is stronger resolution, to undergo any torment then can bee found
in man, as was made apparent in that conspiracy of Peso against
Narrow,[b] who commanded that Epicharis, known to bee of the same
faction, should first presently be set upon the rack,
    [Sidenote: Muliebre corpus impar dolori.]
imagining that being a woman, she would never bee able to overcome the
pain: But all the tortures that he or his could devise, were not able
to draw from her the least confession of any thing that was then
objected against her. The first days question she so utterly
contemned, that the very Chair in which they conveyed her from the
place, did seem as a Chariot wherein she rid, triumphing over the
barbarous usage of their inhumane cruelty. The morrow following brought
thither again, after many rough encounters, remained so unshaken, that
wrath it self grew mad, to see the strokes of an obstinate and
relenting fury fall so in vain upon the softer temper of a Woman: and
at the last took a scarf from about her neck, and by it knits up
within her bosom the knowledge she had of that fact, together with
that little remainder of spirit, whereof by force and violence they
laboured to deprive her.

    [Footnote a: In Perkei ababboth. Bodinus in confutatione
    opinionis Wieri. Plinius in hist. natural. Quintilianus
    Institutionum oratoriarium lib. 5. cap. 10.]

    [Footnote b: Tacit. Annal. lib. 15.]

[c]Former ages have likewise produced Leena, an exemplary president of
this sort, to all posterity, who when Armodius and Aristogiton
having failed of the execution of their enterprise against Hipparchus
a tyrant, had been put to death, she was brought to the torture to be
enforced to declare what other accomplices there were of the conspiracy.
But rather then she should bee compelled thereunto, bit her tongue
asunder, and spit it in the face of the tyrant, that though she would,
yet could not now disclose them. In remembrance whereof the Athenians
caused a Lyon of Brass to bee erected, showing her invincible courage
by the generosity of that beast, and her perseverance in secrecy, in
that they made it without a tongue. Therefore the learned have searched
out other causes thereof, and among the rest, observed these as the most
probable.

    [Footnote c: Tertul. in Apologet. Crinitus de doctrina Christiana
    lib. 9. cap. 8.]

First, they are by nature credulous, wanting experience, and therefore
more easily deceived.

Secondly, [d]they harbour in their breast a curious and inquisitive
desire to know such things as be not fitting and convenient, and so are
oftentimes entangled with the bare show and vizard of goodness. As the
Lady of Rome, who was importune, and vehemently instant upon her
husband, to know what was debated of that day at the Council Table. And
when he could not be at rest, answered, The Priests had seen a Lark
flying in the air with a golden Helmet on his head, and holding a
spear in his foot. Scarce she had this, but presently she told it to
one of her maids: she to another of her fellows, so that report was
spread through the whole City, and went for currant until it received
a check: But all are not of this mould.

    [Footnote d: Binfeldius de confessionibus maleficorum. Peucerus
    de pr[e,]cipius diuinationum generibus in la de +theomanteia+
    Martinus de Arles.]

Thirdly, their complexion is softer, and from hence more easily receive
the impressions offered by the Devil; as when they be instructed and
governed by good Angels, they prove exceeding religious, and
extraordinarily devout; so consenting to the suggestions of evil
spirits, become notoriously wicked, so that there is no mischief above
that of a woman, Eccles. 25. 13. &c.

Fourthly, in them is a greater facility to fall, and therefore the
Devil at the first took that advantage, and set upon Eve in Adams
absence, Genes. 3. 3.

Fifthly, this sex, when it conceives wrath or hatred against any, is
vnplacable, possessed with unsatiable desire of revenge, and transported
with appetite to right (as they think) the wrongs offered unto them:
and when their power herein answers not their will, and are meditating
with themselves how to effect their mischievous proiects and designs,
the Devil[e] takes the occasion, who knows in what manner to content
exulcerated minds, winds himself into their hearts, offers to
teach them the means by which they may bring to posse that rancor which
was nourished in their breasts, and offers his help and furtherance
herein.

    [Footnote e: Exemplum apud Binfeldium reperies de confessionibus
    maleficorum, pag. 32.]

Sixthly, they are of a slippery tongue, and full of words: and therefore
if they know any such wicked practises, are not able to hold them, but
communicate the same with their husbands, children, consorts, and inward
acquaintance; who not consideratly weighing what the issue and end
thereof may be, entertain the same, and so the poison is dispersed.
Thus Dalilah discovered her husbands strength where it lay, unto the
Philistines; and procured his infamous and disastrous ouer-throw.
Judge. 16. 18.

Hitherto in some Propositions I have set down the original of
witch-craft, and other such curious and unlawful Arts, the quality
of the persons agents in the same, the power of the Devil, and his
confederates, the league of association which interchangeably
passes between them, his assuming a body, and framing a voice
  for the performance of that business; that women, and why,
       are most subject to this hellish practice.
            Now the truth of all these shall
              appear by exemplary proofs
                    in the Narration
                       following.


           *       *       *       *       *


           A true Narration of some of those
          Witch-crafts which Marie wife of
      Henry Smith Glover did practise, and of the
 hurts she hath done unto sundry persons by the same:
 confirmed by her own Confession, and from the public
Records of the examination of divers upon their oaths:
    of her death, and execution for the same, which
          was on the twelfth day of January
                      last past.


Marie wife of Henrie Smith, Glover, possessed with a wrathful
indignation against some of her neighbours, in regard that they made
gain of their buying and selling Cheese, which she (using the same
trade) could not doe, or they better (at the least in her opinion) then
she did, often times cursed them, and became incensed with unruly
passions, armed with a settled resolution, to effect some mischievous
proiects and designs against them. The devil who is skilful, and
rejoices of such an occasion offered and knows how to stir up the
evil affected humours of corrupt minds (she becoming now a fit
subject, through this her distemper, to work upon, having the
understanding darkened with a cloud of passionate, and revengeful
affections) appeared unto her amiddes these discontentments,
    [Sidenote: Proposition 4.]
in the shape of a black man, and willed that the she should continue in
her malice, envy, hatred, banning and cursing; and then he would be
revenged for her upon all those to whom she willed evil:
    [Sidenote: Proposition 5.]
and this promise was uttered in a lowe murmuring and hissing voice: and
at that present they entered terms of a compact, he requiring that she
should forsake God, and depend upon him: to which she condescended in
express terms, renouncing God, and betaking herself unto him. I am
sparing by any amplification to enlarge this, but doe barely and
nakedly rehearse the truth, and number of her own words unto me.
After this he presented himself again at sundry times, and that to
this purpose (as may probably bee conjectured) to hold her still in his
possession, who was not able, either to look further into these
subtleties, then the superficial bark thereof, or not discover the
depth of his designments, and in other forms, as of a mist, and of a
ball of fire, with some dispersed spangles of black; and at the last in
prison (after the doom of iudegement, and sentence of condemnation was
passed against her) two several times, in that figure as at the first:
only at the last he seemed to have a pair of horns upon his head, and
these as she came down from her chamber, being sent for to confer
with some learned and reverend Divines, by whose prayers and
instructions she might be brought to the sight and confession of her
grievous offences, be regained and rescued out of his hands, brought to
repentance, and the favour of God, assured hope of mercy, and eternal
life, and at these times he wished her to confess nothing to any of
them, but continue constant in her made promise, rely upon him, and he
would save her. This was too high a strain above his reach to have made
it good, and a note of his false descant, who having compassed this
wretched woman, brought her to a shameful and untimely end; yet doing
nothing herein contrary to his malicious purposes, for he was a
murderer from the beginning, Iohn 8. 44. Now then, to descend
to particulars, and the effects of this hellish association made.
Being thus joined and linked together in a reciprocal league,
 he begins to work for her, in procuring the mischief
       of those whom she maligned, whereof these
           few acknowledged by her self, may
               yield some taste of more,
                   though concealed.


    ?? Her wicked practise against Iohn Orkton.

The first who tasted of the gall of her bitterness was Iohn Orkton a
Sailor, and a man of strong constitution of body, who about some five
years since, returning out of Holland in the Netherland, or low
Countries beyond the Seas, happened, for some misdemeanours committed by
him to strike the son of this Mary Smith (but in such sort as could
not in reason bee offensively taken) who hearing his complaint, came
forth into the street, cursing and banning him therefore, as oftentimes
she did, dwelling in the next adjoining house, and wished in a most
earnest and bitter manner, that his fingers might rot off; whereupon
presently he grew weak, distempered in stomach, and could digest no
meat, nor other nourishment received, and this discrasie or feebleness
continued for the space of three quarters of a year; which time
expired, the fore-mentioned grief fell down from the stomach into his
hands and feet, so that his fingers did corrupt, and were cut off; as
also his toes putrefied & consumed in a very strange and admirable
manner. Nevertheless, notwithstanding these calamities, so long as he
was able, went still to Sea, in the goods and ships of sundry
Merchants (for it was his only means of living) but never could make
any prosperous voyage (as then other men did) either beneficial to the
Owners, or profitable to him self. Whereupon, not willing to bee
hindrance to others, and procure no good for his own maintenance by his
labours, left that trade of life, and kept home, where his former grief
increasing, sought to obtain help and remedy by Surgery, and for
this end went to Yarmouth, hoping to be cured by one there, who was
accounted very skilful: but no medicines applied by the Rules of Art
and Experience, wrought any expected or hoped for effect: for both his
hands and feet, which seemed in some measure every evening to be
healing, in the morning were found to have gone backward, and grown
far worse then before: So that the Surgeon perceiving his labour to
bee wholly frustrate, gave over the cure, and the diseased patient still
continues in a most distressed and miserable estate, unto the which he
was brought by the hellish practises of this malicious woman, who long
before openly in the streets, (whines yet the neighbours knew of no
such thing) rejoicing at the calamity, said, Orkton now lies a
rotting. And no marvel though she could tell that which herself had
done, and her good master would not suffer to be concealed, but that
the testimony of her own tongue should remain as a record towards her
further detection and condemnation, who sought means of her voluntary
accord to be reconciled with the woeful distressed party, but this was
nothing else but to plaster over and disguise her former inhumane and
barbarous actions, for no relief at all followed thereof: for
oftentimes, as hath been proved, the devils and witches his
    [Sidenote: Propositi?? 3.]
instruments doe cause such diseases, which neither the one, nor the
other can remove again. And this is not any vaporous imagination, but
a most undoubted truth. For now this poor man continues still in a
lamentable estate, grief, and pains increasing, without hope of help,
except God in the abundance of his tender mercies vouchsafe to grant
comfort and deliverance.


    ?? Her Wicked practise against Elizabeth Hancock

The second person distressed, by this witch, was Elizabeth Hancock,
then widow, now wife of Iames Scot: the manner, occasion, and
proceeding of whose dealing against her was thus. She coming out of the
town from the shop of one Simon Browne a Silkeman, unto whom she
had carried home some work, which was by him put out unto her; Henry
Smith, as she passed by his door, took her by the hand, and
smilingly said, that his duck (meaning his wife, this woman of whom we
now speak) told him that she had stolen her hen; which words she
then passed over, as only spoken in merriment, and denying the same: in
the mean time, as they were interchanging these words, she came
herself, and directly charged her with the hen, and wished that the
bones thereof might stick in her throat, when she should eat the same:
which speech also she made no great reckoning of, supposing them to be
but words of course, and might bee uttered in jest. Nevertheless,
afterword better considering of the same, conceived much grief, to bee
counted one of so evil quality and disposition, and espying that hen
for which she was accused, to sit upon the hatch of her shop door,
went to her, and moved with the indignity of that slander, and unjust
imputation, told her in some passion and angry manner, that it was a
dishonest part thus to blemish the good name of her neighbours with so
untrue aspersions: whereupon, breaking forth in some violence, she
wished the pox to light upon her, and named her proud Iinny, proud
flurts, and shaking the hand, bade her go in, for she should repent it;
and the same night, within three or four hours after these curses and
imprecations uttered, she was taken and pinched at the heart, and felt a
sudden weakness in all the parts of her body; yet her appetite to
mere nothing diminished, and so continued for the space of three
weeks; in which time, when she was any thing well, would come to the
door, and lean upon the stall, whom this Marie Smith seeing, did
ever ban, adding the former curse, the pox light upon you, can you
yet come to the door? and at the end of these three weeks, being but
very weak, came forth as she used to doe, to take the ayre, this
mischievous woman most bitterly cursed her again, whereupon she went
into the house, fell into such a torturing fit, and nipping at the
heart, that she fainted, hardly recouerable for the space of half an
hour, and so grievously racked and tormented through all parts of her
body, as if the very flesh had been torn from the bones, by the
violent pain whereof she could not refrain, but tore the hair from
off her head, and became as one distraught, bereaved of sense, and
understanding: And the same night the bed whereon she lay, was so
tossed, and lifted up and down, both in her own feeling, and in the
sight of others then present beholders of her extremities, by the space
of one hour or more, that she was therewith exceedingly terrified, &
did think oftentimes in her sleep, that she did see this Marie Smith
standing before her. And this fit continued sixteen hours, during
which passion Edward Drake her father came to the Town, touched with
grief for this torture of his daughter (as parents hearts are relenting
and tender, and natural compassion is soon stirred up in them) took
her urine, went to one for his advice (whose fact herein is no way
iustifiable, and argued but a small measure of religion, and the
knowledge of God in him) who first told unto him the cause of his
coming, that is, to seek help for his daughter, and then added, that
she was so far spent, that if he had stayed but one day longer, the
woman who had wronged her, would have spent her heart, and so become
unrecoverable, and thereupon showed him her face in a Glass; and
further, opened the beginning cause of falling out, which was for a hen,
which before this, Drake neither knew nor heard of, and then gave his
counsel for remedy, which was the matter sought for & desired, & that
was in this order. To make a cake with flower from the Bakers, & to mix
the same instead of other liquor, with her own water, and bake it on the
harth, whereof the one half was to be applied and laid to the region of
the heart, the other half to the back directly opposite; & further, gave
a box of ointment like treacle, which must be spread upon that cake, and
a powder to be cast upon the same, and certain words written in a
paper, to be laid on the likewise with the other, adding this caveat,
that if his daughter did not amend within six hours after the taking of
these receipts, then there was no health or recovery to be looked for: &
further, wished silence to be kept herein, for the women?? who had done
this, would know any thing.

And being thus furnishing with instructions, and returning home, as she
alighted from his horse to enter into that house where his daughter lay
(being the next unto Mary Smiths) she then stood leaning over her
shop window, whom he knew to be that person, which was showed unto him,
and she cursed him passing by, and told his daughter that her Father had
been with a Wizard. And the next day following after they had put in
practise the directions given, she affirmed to divers of the neighbours,
that Drake the afflicted women's father, had been to ask counsel,
and made a Witch Cake, but she would learn how they came to have that
knowledge: yet for the present she found help, and was freed from the
languishing and other conflicts wherewith she was assaulted by the space
of six weeks.

After this, being married unto Iames Scot, a great Cat which kept with
this Witch (of whose infernal both purposes and practises wee now
speak) frequented their house; and upon doing some scathe, her husband
moved therewith, thrust it twice through with his sword: which
notwithstanding those wounds received, ran away: then he stroke it with
all his force upon the head with a great pike staff, yet could not kill
her; but she leapt after this upward almost a yard from the boards of
that chamber where she now was, and crept down: which he perceiving,
willed his lad (a boy of fourteen years) to drag her to the
muck-hill, but was not able; and therefore put her into a sack, and
being in the same, still moved and stirred. Whereupon they put her out
again, and cast her under a pair of stairs, purposing in the morning,
to get more help, and carry her away; but then could not be found,
though all the doors that night were locked, and never heard what
afterword became thereof.

Not long after, this Witch came forth with a Birchin broom, and
threatened to lay it upon the head of Elizabeth Scot, and defiled her
clothes therewith, as she swept the street before her shop door, and
that in the sight of her husband, who not digesting this indignity
offered unto his wife, threatened that if she had any such fits, as she
endured being a Widow before marriage, he would hang her. At this she
clapped her hands, and said he killed her Cat. And within two or three
days after this interchange of words between them, his wife was
perplexed with the like pain and grief at her heart, as formerly she
had been; and that for two days and a night: wherefore her husband
went to this wrathful and malicious person, assuring that if his wife
did not amend, he would accuse her to the Magistirate, and cause the
[a]rigour of the law to be executed upon her, which is due to such
malefactors. These things were done some three years since. The
party troubled yet lives, but in no confirmed health, nor perfect
soundness of body.

    [Footnote a: Witches can by no meanes bee so easily brought to
    recall the mischiefe they haue done, as by threats and stripes.
    Remigius in D??monolatria, lib 3. c. 3.]


    Her wicked practises against Cicely Balye.

A third subject whereupon this wrathful women's anger wrought, was
Cicely Balye, then servant to Robert Coulton, now wife of William
Wax, who sweeping the street before her masters door upon a Saturday
in the evening, Mary Smith began to pick a quarrel about the manner
of sweeping, and said unto her she was a great fat-tail'd sow, but that
fatness should shortly be pulled down and abated. And the next night
being Sunday immediately following, a Cat came unto her, sate upon her
breast, with which she was grievously tormented, and so oppressed, that
she could not without great difficulty draw her breath, and at the same
instant did perfectly see the said Mary in the chamber where she lay,
who (as she conceived) set that Cat upon her, and immediately after fell
sick, languished, and grew exceeding lean; and so continued for the
space of half a year together, during the whole continuance in her
masters service; until departing from him, she dwelt with one Mistress
Garoway, and then began to bee amended in her health, and recover of
her former pining sickness: for this Witch had said, that so long as
she dwelt near her, she should not be well, but grow from evil to
worse.

Thus every light trifle (for what can be less then sweeping of a little
dust awry?) can minister matter to set on fire a wrathful indignation,
and inflame it unto desired revenge, the Devil being willing to
apprehend and take hold upon such an occasion, that so he might do some
pleasing office to his bond-slaue, whom she adored in submiss manner,
upon her knees, with strange gestures, uttering many mumuring, broken,
and imperfect speeches, as this Cicely did both hear and see, there
being no other partition between the chamber wherein she performed
these rites, and the house of her master with whom she then dwelt, but
only a thin seeling of board, through a cranny or rift of whereof she
looked, listened attentively unto her words, and beheld diligently her
behaviour, and might have seen and heard much more, but that she was
with the present spectacle so affrighted, that she hastened down in
much fear and distemper.


    Her wicked practise against Edmund Newton.

The fourth endammaged by this Hag, was one Edmund Newton: the
discontentment did arise from this ground; Because he had bought
several bargains of Holland cheese, and sold them again, by which she
thought her benefit to be somewhat impaired, using the like kind of
trading. The manner of her dealing with him was in this sort. At every
several time buying Cheese he was grieously afflicted, being thrice,
and at the last either she or a spirit in her likeness did appear unto
him, and whisked about his face (as he lay in bed) a wet cloth of very
loathsome savour; after which he did see one clothed in russet with a
little bush beard, who told him he was sent to look upon his fore
leg, and would heal it; but rising to show the same perceiving he
had cloven feet, refused that offer, who then (these being no vain
conceits, or fantasies, but well advised and diligently considered
obseruances) suddenly vanished out of sight. After this she sent her
Imps, a Toad, and Crabs crawling about the house, which was a shop
planchered with boards, where his servants (he being a Shoemaker) did
work: one of which took that toad, put it into the fire, where it made
a groaning noise for one quarter of an hour before it was consumed;
during which time Mary Smith who sent it, did endure, (as was
reported) torturing pains, testifying the felt grief by her out-cryes
then made.

The sickness which he first sustained, was in manner of a madness or
frenzy, yet with some interposed release of extremity: so that for
thirteen or fourteen weeks together he would be of perfect memory,
other times distracted and deprived of all sense. Also the joints and
parts of his body were benumbed, besides other pains and griefs from
which he is not yet freed, but continues in great weakness, disabled
to perform any labour, whereby he may get sufficient and competent
maintenance. And by the council of some, sending for this woman by whom
he was wronged, that he might scratch her (for this hath gone as
currant, and may plead prescription for warrant a* foul sin among
Christians to think one Witch-craft can drive out another) his nails
turned like feathers, having no strength to lay his hands upon her.

And it is not improbable but that she had dealt no better with others
then these above mentioned. For M^r Thomas Yonges of London,
Fishmonger, reported unto me, that after the demand of a debt due unto
M^r Iohn Mason, Silkeman of the same City, whose Widow he married,
from Henry Smith Glover her husband, some execrations and curses being
wished unto him, within three or four days (being then gone to
Yarmouth in Norfolk upon necessary business) there fell sick, and was
tortured with exceeding and massacring griefs, which by no means
(having used the advise of sundry learned and experienced Physicians in
Norwich) could in any part be mitigated, and so extraordinarily vexed
thirteen months, was constrained to go on Crutches, not being able to
feed himself, and amended not before this mischievous woman was
committed to prison (accused for other wickednesses of the like kind)
at which time (so near as he could conjecture) he then received some
release of his former pains, though at the present when he made this
relation, which was at Candlemas last past, had not perfectly recovered
his wonted strength: for his left hand remained lame, and without use.

But thus much by the way only, omitting how before this accident a
great Water-dogge ran over his bed, the door of the chamber where he
lay being shut, no such one known (for careful enquiry was made)
either to have been in that houfe where he lodged, or in the whole
Town at any time.

I doe not insist upon this, because she did not nominate him or any
other unto vs, but only those four already expressed: and for the
wrongs done to them, she craved mercy at Gods hands, as for all other
her sins, and in particular for that of Witch-craft, renounced the
Devil, embraced the mercies of God purchased by the obedience of Iesus
Christ, and professed that her hope was only by his suffering and
passion to bee saved. And all these, that is to say, her former grievous
offences committed against God, and his people, her defiance of the
Devil, and reposing all confidence of salvation in Christ Iesus alone,
and his merits, she in particular manner confessed openly at the place of
execution, in the audience of multitudes of people gathered together (as
is usual at such times) to be beholders of her death. And made there
also profession of her faith, and hope of a better life hereafter; and
the means whereby she trusted to obtain the same, as before, hath
been specified. And being asked, if she would be contented to have a
Psalm sung, answered willingly that she desired the same, and appointed
it herself, The Lamentation of a Sinner, whose beginning is, Lord
turn not away thy face, &c. And after the ending thereof thus finished
her life: So that in the judgment of charity we are to conceive the
best, and think she rests in peace, notwithstanding her heinous
transgressions formerly committed: for there is no maladay incurable to
the Almighty Physician, Essay 1. 18 Ezech. 33. 11. Therefore Caine
did injury to God, when convicted of the barbarous and unnatural
murder of his righteous brother, cried out that his sin was greater
then could be forgiven, Gen. 4. 13 for Gods mercy is greater then
mans misery can be. And even for the like unto this very fact, we have a
book case, already adjudged, and ouer-ruled in those Ephesians, who
brought their conjuring books, sacrificed them in the fire, ??stimated
at the [b]value of nine hundred pounds of our money, repented of
their[c] sins, and obtained mercy, Acts 19. verse. 19.

    [Footnote b: Bud[e,]us de ass. lib. 5.]

    [Footnote c: The Ephesians were infamous for their Magicall
    practises, Appollonius professing the same in the Citie, so that
    it grewe into a prouerb, +grammata Ephesia+ the Ephesian letters,
    which were certaine Characters and wordes, by vertue whereof they
    obtained good successe in all businesse, victory against others,
    euasion and escape from dangers; and as we reade in Suidas, a
    Milesian armed with these letters, ouer-came thirty Champions in
    the games of Olimpus, but being remoued by the Magistrate,
    hauing intelligence thereof, himselfe was subdued. Of these see
    Athen[e,]us Deipnosophiston lib. 12. Hesichius in his
    Lexicon. Plutarchus qu??stionum conuiualium, lib 7. cap. 5.]




    ?? The eight Proposition, and first consequent.


Now then from this premised narration, these two corollaries or
consequents do necessarily follow.

It is not lawful for any Christian to consult with a witch or wizard,
or go to them for help. God himself, whose commandment is and must
be the rule of our life & direction hath forbidden it, Leuit. 19. 31.
and 20. 6. Deuter. 18. 10.11. And the Imperial laws, have been in
this case very respective.[a] Therefore, Leo the Emperor straightly
enjoins, that none should resort unto them, and stileth their advice
nothing but mere impostures and deceit; and in the [b]Decrees collected
by Gratian, the teachers of the people are seriously exhorted to
admonish them, that magical arts and enchantments cannot heal any
infirmity: and that they bee the dangerous snares, and subtleties of
that ancient enemy of mankind, by which he indeuoureth to entangle
them[c]: and these so straight and severe prohibitions are not without
just and weighty cause. For,

    [Footnote a: Cod lib. 9. titulo 18. L. nullus & L. Nemo.]

    [Footnote b: Gratianus decretorum parte 2. caus. 26. qu. 7.]

    [Footnote c: Dan??us in dialogo de sortiarijs cap. 6.]

First, wee must have no commerce or dealing with the devil, either
directly and immediately, or mediately and indirectly; for we ought to
have our recourse to God alone in all distresses, and this is that which
Eliah spake with great indignation unto the messengers of Ahaziah,
who went to enquire of Baal-zelub, for the recovery of their Lords
health, 2. King. 1. 3.[d] So that wee must not seek to Satan, or any
of his ministers. For none can serve two masters, Matt. 6. 24. But as
religious Iehosaphat, when we know not what to doe, then lift up our
eyes to heaven, 2 Chron. 20. 12.

    [Footnote d: Martinus de Arles in tractatu de superstitionibus.
    Iohannes Gerson de erroribus circa artem magicam articulo 5.]

Secondly, that help which any receive from them brings destructon of
our souls, for such as seek for relief this way, make a[e] separation
& departing from God, which is the death of the soul. And though it may
be objected, that some have received benefit hereby, yet these are not
one of ten. And further, wee are not to judge herein of the
lawfulness of these actions by the success, but rest upon the
commandment, for it falls out sometime, that a thief and common
robber by the high way, may live in more abundance, then those who with
a lawful and honest trade painefully maintain themeelues, yet
therefore he is not justified. And when wee have recourse unto others
beside God, we bewray herein our [f]distrust, infidelity, contempt and
rebellion against him, which grievous sins bring his wrath and
eternal destruction. But let it be taken for granted, that wee may
receive good by them, yet this maxim is sure, & a truth vnrepealeable,
which no distinction can elude; we must not doe evil that good may come
thereof, Rome. 3. 8.[g] yea, it were better to end our days in any
extremity whatsoever, then to use these for our helpers.

    [Footnote e: In curing diseases the diuell respecteth two ends:
    the one, that he might seeme to keep the promise he hath made with
    those his slaues, and retaine them in their malicious practises
    and infidelity: the other, that hee might draw their faith and
    trust from God, who are thus healed by witches and wisards his
    instruments, and cast them downe headlong into destruction of
    their soules: or if they misse of hoped reliefe which often times
    so commeth to passe, God withstanding their attempts, then to
    wound their consciences, and driue them to despaire.]

    [Footnote f: Nauarrus in Enchiridio siue manuali confessariorum
    cap 11.]

    [Footnote g: Chrysost. cont. Iud[e,]os home 6.]

Thirdly, they[h] cure not diseases but in show, except such as
themselves have inflicted, otherwise those doe return, as is reported
of Adrianus the[i] Emperor, who troubled with a dropsy, by magical
charms did oftentimes empty the water thereof, but in a short space
increased again; and perceiving the same to grow worse & worse, sought
to dispatch and rid himself of life, by poison, or the sword, or some
other desperate attempts. Or a worse malady (the first being abated)
follows: as I have known one, who using the help of a wizard for the
cure of a sore in his breast, prescribed in this sort: crossed the place
affected with his thumb, and mumbled to himself some words in secret,
after gave the patient a powder like the ashes of wood, which was to be
boiled in running water, and with it to wash the ulcer, after certain
clouts were to be applied, with special care to lay that side of the
clout unto the sore, which was by him crossed, and marked; and all these
clothes must at once be bound upon it, and every day the lowest removed
or taken away: thus in short time that anguish and grief ceased; but
not long after the party fell into a more grievous infirmity, and still
continues therein. Or if the evil be taken from the[k] person
presently afflicted, then is it laid upon his friends children or
cattle, and sometime it falls to the lot of the witch herself, so
that always the devil is a devil, doing evil, and working mischief.

    [Footnote h: Tatianus oratione tertia contra Gr??cos.]

    [Footnote i: Xiphilinus ex Dion. in Adriano +manganeiais men te
    se kai go??tiais ekeonto pote tou hugrou, palin de autou
    epimplato.+]

    [Footnote k: Bodine proueth this by many examples in his
    D??monomania, lib. 3. cap. 2.]

Fourth, a [l]wizard, witch, or sorcerer can not relieve any but by his
or her invocation, and help of the devil, but this fact is absoluteIy,
and without exception, wicked, and can by no limitation or circumstance
bee made tolerable: Therefore they who require this at their hands,
which they cannot perform without committing of sin, be liable to the
same vengeance and wrath of God to which they are; for not only the
principal offenders, but the [m]accessories, and consenters to their
evil, are worthy of death, Rome. 1. 32.

    [Footnote l: Binfeldius de confessionibus maleficorum. Cardinalis
    Caietanus in summula titulo de maleficio. Toletus in summa casuum
    conscienti??, sine instructione sacerdotum li. 4. c. 16.]

    [Footnote m: Gratianus in Decretis parte 2, causa 26. qu[e,]st.
    2. sect. Qui sine saluatore, &c.]

Now before I conclude this point, because by these kind of creatures,
many toys bee used, to shadow and mask the devils suggestion and
works, it shall not be amiss to mention some of them, and among the
rest be [n]characters written or graven in plates of mettle: and for
these it is most certain that Quantities have no active quality; and
therefore, if any expected success according to desire doe follow in
the use thereof, it proceeds from the illusion of Satan, and is his
work, that hereby he might win credit to his crafty fleights and
conveyances, and procure to himself authority, establishing the
kingdom of darkness, withdraw men from resting upon God, and reposing
their trust in his almighty power, and boundless mercy, and solicit
them to expect help from him. There are besides these, other idle
trifles (for they deserve no better name which are appointed to be hung
about the neck) for Amulets, as [o]powerful and effectual remedies
against certain diseases, and pictures made of gold, brass, lead, wax,
&c. which neither have nor can have any other virtue, then that which
they doe receive from the matter whereof they be framed, for the figure
works not as a cause of alteration; but if it bring to posse any other
effect that is from the power of the devil an old enemy, and crafty
deluder of mankind, and therefore, presupposes a contract made with
him: wherefore [p]Antoninus Caracalla condemned those who used the
same, for the help of Tertian and Quart agues, and Constantius[q]
decrees such to be worthy capital punishment, and put to death. And
that natural cover wherewith some children are borne, and is called by
our women, the silly how, Midwives were wont to sell to credulous
Advocates and Lawyers, as an especial means to furnish them with
eloquence[r] and persuasive speech, and to stop the mouths of all,
who should make any opposition against them: for which cause one
[s]Protus was accused by the Clergy of Constantinople to have
offended in this matter. And Chrysostome often accuses Midwives for
reserving the same to Magical uses. And Clemens[t] Alexandrinus
gives vs to understand of one Erecestus, who had two enchanted
rings, so framed, that by the sound thereof he had direction for the fit
time and opportunity in managing all the businesses he intended, and
yet notwithstanding was privily murdered, though he had warning given
by that sound which was his usual instructor. Thus, none can escape the
revenging hand of God, which pursues those who have infeoffed
themselves to such vanities, and are besotted with these unlawful
curiosities. But among all other, charms and enchanting spells, have
gotten the start of the rest, which some think absolutely lawful, and
may upon warrantise bee used, and plead prescription for their
justification; for wee read in Homer[u] that Vlysses being wounded
by words, stayed the flux of blood; and [x]Cardanus tells vs, that
himself cutting his lip, could by no means restrain the flowing
blood, until he charmed it, and then presently stanched: but dare not
affirm whether his own confidence, or the words did make this
restraint. I might add to these, that infallible means (as is
supposed) by finding out a thief with a Sieve and a pair of Shears,
with that conjunction [y]Dies, mies, Iescet, &c. and the rest of such
senseless and monstrous terms, a Riddle that Oedipus himself could
not unfold. But because this conceit of charming hath ouer-spread it
self in this Sunneset of the world, and challenges a lawful
approbation from the authority and practise of ancient [z]Physicians,
yea and found some [aa]Divines to be their Patrons respectively, and
with clauses of mitigation, I think it very necessary to show the
unlawfulness thereof. Wherefore,

First, they had their original and beginning from the devil, who abode
not in the truth, Iohn 8. 44. was cast down with the apostate angels
to hell, and delivered into chains of darkness, 2. Pet. 2. 4. who
envying mans felicity received into grace after the [bb]fall, himself
eternally rejected, omitted no occasion to weaken and overthrow the
same, that the benefit thereof might come but to a few, and the
greatest number perish with him for ever. Whereupon he endeavoured to
inwrappe the weaker sort of that frail corporation in superstitions,
beguile them with doubtful and false oracles, and bring to a form of
worship contrary to that which God had commanded, [cc]whereby the
world began to abound with Idolatry, disobedience, contempt, murders,
vncleanenesse, lusts, thefts, lying, and such like outrages: and that
he might with his infections empoison them more dangerously, and
sovereign in their hearts, he undertook to work wonders, imitating
such miracles as God had done, and devised cunningly many subtle
sleights and legerdemaines, and for this end most blasphemously abused
the glorious and holy name of God, and the word uttered by his mouth,
and represented a false show of those effects, which he had wrought in
nature: and herein leveled at two intentions, one to reproach God, and
countercheck his works; the other to ouer-mask and cover his own
secret traps and frauds, persuading men, that by the power of words
these things were brought to pass, which must needs therefore be of
great efficacy: seeing that the world & all things therein were so made
of nothing; for he spake, and they were created, and thus practised to
disgrace, and extenuate, that admirable and great work of Creation, and
cause men to make lighter account of the Creator, seeing that they also
(instructed by him) were enabled thorough the pronunciation of certain
words contrived into a special form, either to infuse new strength
into things, or deprive them of that which formerly they had, or alter
the course of Nature, in raising tempests, stirring up thunder and
lightning; in [dd]taming serpents, and depriving them of their natural
fierceness and venom, and cause wilde beasts to become meek and
tractable, yea in seeming to make sensible bodies; as clouds, wind,
rain & the like. And thus the devil is that father who begot Charms,
and brought them forth, not powerful in themselves, but by that
inter-league which he hath with those who are invassaled unto him.

    [Footnote bb: De differentia inter Diabolos & homines peccatores
    Augustinus in Enchiridio cap. 28. & in suis ad illum c??mentarijs
    Lambertus Dan[e,]us.]

    [Footnote cc: Peucerus de generibus Diuinationum & titulo de
    incantationibus.]

    [Footnote dd: Frigidus in pratis cantando rumpitur anguis Virg.
    ecloga 8.]

Secondly, God doth as straightly prohibit them, and severely punish the
practisers thereof, as others offending in any exercise of unlawful
arts, Deuteronomy. 18. 10.11. There shall not be found among you (instructing
the Israelites his people) a charmer, &c. for these are abomination
unto the Lord, &c. And this is recorded in the Catalogue of those sins
of Manasses, by which he sought to provoke God unto anger, 2. Kin.
21. 8. 2. Chronicles 33. 6.

Thirdly, words have no virtue,[ee] but either to signify and express
the conceits of the mind, or to affect the ears of the Auditors, so
that they can work nothing but in these two respects: first of the
matter which is uttered by them, which understood of the hearers, affect
the mind diversely, and that especially when there is joined with it a
comeliness of action and pronunciation, as wee we see oftentimes in the
speeches of the Ministers of the Word, and in the pleadings of Orators.
As when Paul reasoned before F[oe]lix and Drusilla his wife, of
Temperance, Righteousness, and Judgment to come, he trembled, Acts
24. 25. [ff]being guilty to himself of fraudulent and cruel dealing,
of lasciviousness and a filthy life, and therefore might justly fear
vengeance for the same.

    [Footnote ee: +rh??mata Blast??mata no??mat??n, & ph??n??+ Etymologicis

    [Footnote ff: Pr[e,]fectus Iud[e,]?? impositus cuncta malefacta
    sibi impune ratus est, &c. Tacitus Annalium lib. 12. & history??
    lib. 5. per omnem s??uitiam ac libidinem ius regium servile ingenio
    exercuit.]

A like example to this is that in King Agrippa, though working upon a
better subject, Act. 26. 28. And if I may conjoin Divine eloquence
with Humane, it is memorable, that while [gg]Tully pleaded before
C??sar for Ligarius, accused by Tubero, to have been confederate
with Pompey, purposing to put him to death, as an enemy, when the
Orator altered, and in Rhetorical manner enforced his speech, the other
changed accordingly his countenance, and betrayed the piercing words to
be so affecting, that the supplications, when he came once to urge and
mention the battle of Pharsalia, (trembling and dismayed) did fall
from his hands, having the passions of his mind extraordinarily moved,
and absolved the offender. Or else when by their pleasantness, with
delight they slide into the hearts of men, and ravish their affections:
and thus it was with [hh]Augustine, as he acknowledges of himself,
that being at Milaine where he was baptised by S. Ambrose, when he
heard the harmony which was in singing of the Psalms, the words pierced
his ears, the truth melted his heart, his passions were moved, and
showers of tears with delight fell from his eyes.[ii] But these effects
are wrought only in such who understand that which is spoken, but
neither of both these properties are to bee found in the Charms of
Wizards: besides, that they are conceived and expressed in monstrous and
unknown terms, not intelligible, and without signification: and
therefore the effects they produce being[kk] supernatural must proceed
from that secret compact, the least made with the Devil.

    [Footnote gg: +arxamenos legein ho kiker??n huperphu??s ekoinei+

Fourthly, these charms are mere mockeries, and gross abuses, both of
God, and Men his creatures, I will give you a taste of one or two,
whereby you may judge of the rest, for they came all out of one shop,
and are fashioned in one forge, and have the same workman or Artificer.
[ll]An old woman craving help for blear eyes, had delivered a Billet
of Paper to wear about her neck, in which was written, The Devil
pull out thine eyes, and recovered. Another tied a scroll to a sick
man, full of strange Characters, with which were intermingled a few
names of Devils, as Lucifer, Satan, Beelzebub, Oriens, Behal,
Mammon, Beuflar, Northern, Oleasar, &c. and other of this sort;
but what manner of blessing this was, and how likely to be medicinable,
a Christian truly instructed in Gods word knows; and the Lord who is
the father of mercies, and God of all comfort, preserve vs from such
blasphemies, which are the Devils Sacrifices.

    [Footnote ll: Godelmannus in tractatu de magis, Veneficis &c.
    lib. 1. cap. 8. n?? 25 & 27. vide Simonem Maiolum colloquiorum siue
    dierum caniculorum parte 2, colloquio 3.]

Fifthly, the discreeter sort among the Heathen, by that small glimpse of
natural reason which they had, misliked of these things: [mm]And
therefore Cato among the rest of admonitions to the Bailiff of his
husbandry, gives this charge, to ask no advice of any Southsaier,
Diviner, Wizard, or Nativity Calculator. [nn]And Columella utterly
forbids all acquaintance with Witches, whereby ignorant people are
enforced to expense detestable Arts, and mischievous deeds.
[oo]Hippocrates doth almost like a Christian discourse of this point,
and condemn the whole practise of this Art, as injurious unto God, who
only purges sins, and is our preserver; and for these fellows who
make profession of such wonder-working, brands them for Impostors and
deceivers. I conclude with that remarkable saying of an ancient
Divine;[pp] These vanities doe separate and with-draw vs from God,
though they may seem to have something in them to allure and delight
vs; yet let no Christian entertain them, whose hope ought to be settled
in God alone. And if thou be in distress, or afflicted with sickness
of body, and feel no present release or comfort, what then? here is the
trial of thy patience, have not recourse to superstitious and unlawful
helpers, although they promise thee present remedy; and when they
fore-tell thee of things which doe truly according to the prediction to
fall out, believe them not, follow the example of Christ, who rebuked
the Devil, though he called him (as he was indeed) the Son of God. For
under the veil of truth he shadows falsehood; even as if one should
sweeten with honey or sugar the brim of the Cup wherein he brings
poison: But some will say, they call upon the name of the Lord of
Sabbath. Well, but this title they give not to God, but to the Devil:
therefore betake thou thy self to God alone, crave health at his hand,
and follow the Apostles direction; If any bee sick among you, let him
call for the Elders of the Church, and let him pray, Iames 5. 14.

    The ninth Proposition, and second Corrolary.


There hath always been some wanton, or perverse wits, who only to make
trial of their skill, would take in hand to defend absurd positions,
and commend both such things and persons, which were infamous, and
contemptible as [a]Phauorinus writ the praise of the Quartain Ague,
one of the gout, blindness, and deafness, [b]Lucian of a fly,
[c]Erasmus of folly, [d]Synesius of baldness, [e]Glaucus in
Plato of injustice. And among the exercises of the [f]ancient Orators,
wee find those who strained all their understanding to blaze the honour
of that witless and deformed Coward Thersites. And this they have
performed with great Art and eloquence, only to show their faculty, but
never in good earnest took such a matter in hand. And therefore more
deeply is he to be censured, who hath made himself an advocate to
plead the cause of [g]Witches, and defend th[~e] as innocent. And
because this is a dangerous example, and doth draw those who are evil
affected to offend, hoping for patronage of their impiety, I add for
conclusion this last proposition: Wizards, Witches, and the whole rabble
of Sorcerers (no kind excepted) are justly liable[h] to extreme
punishment. The arguments alleged for proof hereof, are many: I will
make choice of a few (with reference to such authors in whose writings
more may bee found) and those which are most[i] demonstrative.

First, God himself hath enacted that p[oe]nil statute, Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live. Exod. 22 18. and names here a [k]woman
practising this damnable Art for two reasons: First, they are more
inclinable hereunto then man. Secondly, that though their fault may
seem, as being the weaker, excusable, and is in this respect
extenuated by some, yet is not therefore to bee spared, whether of that
sort which they call [l]good, or bad (for so are they distinguished) &
there be some who never brought[m] harm upon any in body, goods, or
mind. The cause of this so sharpe a doom, is their compacting with the
Devil, openly or secretly, whereby they covenant to use his help, in
fulfilling their desires, and by this means make themselves guilty of
horrible impiety: for in this they renounce the Lord, who hath created
them; make no account of his favour and protection, cut themselves off
from the covenant made with him in baptism, from the communion of
Saints, the true fellowship and service of God; and on the contrary
yield themselves by this confederacy, to Satan, as their God (and
therefore nothing more frequent and usual in their mouths, then my God
will do this and that for me) him they continually fear and honour. And
thus do at the last become professed enemies both to God and Man. You
may add to this former law, that which is Leuit. 19. 26. & cap. 6.
You shall use no enchantment: the soul that turns after such as have
familiar spirits, and are Wizards, to go a whooring after them, I will
set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his
people, &c. Again, Deuteronomy. 18. 10. There shall not bee found among
you any that uses Divination, nor an observer of times, or an
enchanter, or a Witch, or a Charmer, or a consulter with familiar
spirits, a Wizard, or Necromancer. And that God might show how[n] much
Manasses had provoked him to wrath, through his transcendent and
outrageous sins in the Catalogue thereof, his conspiring with Devils
is mentioned 1. King 21. 8. And therefore is deprived of his kingdom,
bound in fetters, and carried captive unto Babel, 2. Chron. 33.
6.11. and though he repented of these outrageous and enormious
transgressions, yet God would not bee appeased for them fifty years
after he was dead, Ierem. 15. 4.

Secondly, the civil laws in this case are most strict, decreeing them
to bee burned, and their goods confiscate, though they were persons of
quality, and honourable, seated in dignity, and place of authority:[o]
and there is a severe constitution made by [p]Charles the fifth in late
days against them, that though they shall not have done, or be
convinced to have hurt any, yet because they attempted a thing
unlawful, and abominable unto God, are extraordinarily to be punished.
And concerning this particular, S. Augustine discourses excellently,
worthy to be read, de ciu. dei. l. 8. c. 19.

Thirdly, God wills those should bee put to death, who by Diabolical
and unlawful Arts, do endeavour to help or harm others, whether in act
they perform the same, or purpose with intention, conceiving and
thinking they can do it, with rank Witches must needs be marshalled;
and therefore justly subject to deserved punishment.

Fourthly, all Idolaters are to dye by divine appointment, Deu. 17. 5.
But I think no mans forehead is so brazen, that will stand Proctor, and
plead guiltless for these sort of people, who devote themselves wholly
to the Devil, though never so closely, and with great and cautelous
secrecy: and no doubt God therefore was revenged of the Templars, and
their detestable wickedness practised in darkness and obscurity, who
all[q] perished, as it were, in a moment for the same; of which at the
full we may be informed in our own ancient histories.

    [Footnote q: Anno Domini 1312. whose order began 1123. Thomas
    Walsingham in the life of K. Edward the 2^d, in his English
    history, an in his Hypodigma Neustri[e,].]

Fifthly, they doe solicit others to be of their profession (which is
one clause of that contract made between them and the Devil) and
consecrate their childen unto him: and against this, there is an
especial caution put in Deuteronomy 13. 6.9.10.

Sixtly, they deserve death as inhumane and barbarous tyrants, for
lingringly vt sentient se more, that they may feel how they doe decay
by degrees, seek the utter overthrow of those whom they doe malign: and
as a further appendix to this, oftentimes by the help of their grand
teacher, sow discord between husband and wife, solicit maidens, yea
enforce both them, and married women to unclean, and unlawful lusts,
and herein implore the help of the devil, to accomplish their
malicious designs, which trangression is capital.

Seventhly, the exercise of this act or vanity is punishable by death,
although it be practised but only in sport and jest, which appear
thus, because God hath seriously forbidden (and under no less
forfeiture of life it self) to ask counsel of a Soothsayer or
Conjurer; if this then be a crime of such nature, in those, who it may
bee herein thought not to doe evil, there is no reason to induce any to
think that he will spare the wilful, and purposed authors thereof,
and Magicians, who work only juggling tricks, and illusions, and
fore-tell some future things, as yet unknown until they doe so fall
out, are not freed from the sentence condemnatory, much more then those
who willingly, and upon premeditated malice, murder or impair the life
and good estate of other, deserve to stand parallel with them. And there
can no reason be yielded of this so sharp a censure, but only because
they have learned, and accordingly exercise unlawful arts, for
whosoever endeavours to bring that thing to posse, by pretending
natural means, which exceeds the power of Nature, and is now
thereunto enabled either by God, or the ministry of good Angels at his
appointment, he must of necessity have this faculty communicated by
some combination and inter league with the devil.

Eightly, the Judge or civil Magistrate is bound by virtue of that
office, and superiority he sustains in the common-wealth, to purge
and free that place, in, and over which he hath command, of all
malefactors, which if he doe neglect, then is a double offender, against
the Law both of Justice and Charity; for he is obliged by duty to
foresee (so much as in him lies) that the public state should be
secured, which it concerns to have offenders punished, otherwise he
makes himself partner with them in their outrages and offences, and
stands answerable for those damages sustained by the whole body of
the people in general, or undergone by any particular of the same, for
sparing of the wicked[r] is hurting the good, and he that doth not
repress and forbid evil (when it is in his power) doth countenance and
maintain it.

    [Footnote r: Pythagoras apud Stob??um.]

Much more might be added, and many examples produced, to manifest, how
in all Nations these odious company of witches, and the like have ever
been accounted detestable; and for their impious deeds requited with
never dying shame, and utter confusion, and justly by law executed; for
among the Romans, Mathematitians,[s] and Magicians by the Decree of the
Senate were expelled out of all Italy: and amongst these Pituanus was
thrown down from the rock Tarpeius, and crushed apiece. Martius
by the Consuls put to death with the sound of a Trumpet without the gate
Exquilina: Publicia and Licinia women,[t] and seventy more
witches hanged. The [u]speedy judgement of the Athenians, witness of
their hatred against these kind of malefactors, is much commended, who
without any other solemnity of proceeding at the only accusation of a
Maid, without delay put one Lemnia a witch to death: and it is
memorable which Ammianus[x] Marcellinus hath left in record, that one
Hilarius, because he committed his son young, and not of mature
years, to be taught and instructed unto a Conjurer, was adjudged to
die, and escaping from the hands of the executioner, who had negligently
bound him, drawn by force out of the next church of the Christians to
which he fled as unto a Sanctuary, and executed.

The end of [y]Varasolo, a famous Enchantress in Hungarie is
dreadful, who for her sundry witcheries was cast into prison, and there
constrained through extremity of hunger, to rear off and eat the flesh
of her own legs and arms, and at the last, impatient of further
delay, there murdered herself, and shortened the span of her life.

But here I stay my hand, take it from the table, and the rather,
because much hath already been spoken to this purpose. Wherefore, for
conclusion, I shut up this whole Treatise with a remarkable speech of a
noble [z]King; Let the straight rigour of law bee inflicted upon all,
both practisers and partakers with wizards, by putting any confidence in
them; for it is ungodly for man to be remiss and favourable unto those
whom divine piety, and our duty to God will not suffer unpunished. For
what folly were it to forsake the Creator and Giver of life, and to
follow the author of death? this dishonest fact, unbeseeming, and
utterly repugnant to the credit and reputation of a Judge, be far
from him. Let none countenance that which the Laws doe condemn, for
all are by the Regal Edicts to bee punished with death, who intermeddle
with such forbidden and unlawful Arts.

    the whole rabble of this blacke Guard) with Iannes and
    Iambres, and Simon Magus, are to be tormented with endlesse
    paines in eternall fire. Cornelius Agrippa De vanitate
