Agnis Simpson the eldest Witch ofthem al, dwelling in Haddington, Agnes Tompsonof Edenbrough, Doctor Feign, alias IohnCunningham, master of the School at Saltpans[pg 090]in Lowthian, of whose life and strangeactes, you shall hear more largely in the end ofthis discourse: these were by the said GeillisDuncane accused, as also George Motts wifedwelling in Saltpans, Robert Griersonn skipper,and Jennet Bandilandis, with the Porterswife of Seaton, the Smith at the brigge Halliswith innumerable others in that parts, anddwelling in those bounds aforesaid: of whomsome are already executed, the rest remain inprison, to receive the doom of Judgment at theKings majesties will and pleasure.The said Geillis Duncan also caused EwphameMeealrean to be apprehended, who conspiredand performed the death of her Godfather, andwho used her art upon a gentleman being oneof the Lords and Justices of the Session, forbearing good will to her Daughter: she also causedto be apprehended one Barbara Nipper, for bewitchingto death Archibalde, last Earl ofAngus, who languished to death by witchcraftand yet the same was not suspected, but that hedied of so strange a disease, as the Phisitionknew not how to cure or remedy the same: butof all other the said witches, these two last beforerecited, were reputed for as civil honestwomen as any that dwelled within the City ofEdenbrough, before they were apprehended.Many other besides were taken dwelling in[pg 091]Lies, who are detained in prison, until hisMaiesties further will and pleasure be known:of whose wicked doings you shall particularlyheare, which was as follows.This aforeaside Agnis Simpson which wasthe elder Witch, was taken and brought to Haliciudhouse before the Kings Majesty and sundryother of the nobility of Scotland, where shows straightly examined, but all the perswasionswhich the Kings majesty used to her with the restof his counsel, might not provoke or induce herto confess any thing, but stood stiffly in the deniallof all that was laid to her charge: whervponthey caused her to be conveyed away toprison, there to receive such torture as hath beenlately provided for witches in that country: andforasmuch as by due examination of witchcraftand witches in Scotland, it hath lately beenefound that the devil doth generally markethem with a privy mark, by reason the Witcheshaue confessed themselves, that the Diuelldooth lick them with his tongue in some privy partof their body, before he doth receive themto be his servants, which mark commonly isgiuen them under the hair in some part of theirbodye, whereby it may not easily be found out orscene, although they be searched: and generallyso long as the mark is not seen to those whichsearch them, so long the parties that hath the[pg 092]mark will never confess any thing. Therforeby special commandment this Agnis Sampsonhad all her hair shaven of, in each part of herbodie, and her head thrawen with a rope accordingto the custom of that Country, being apaine most grievous, which she continued almostan hour, during which time she wouldnot confess any thing until the Devils markewas found upon her privities, then she immediatlyeconfessed whatsoever was demanded ofher, and iustifying those persons aforesaid to benotorious witches.Item, the said Agnis Tompson was afterbrought again before the Kings Majesty andhis Counsel, and being examined of the meetingsand detestable dealings of those witches,she confessed that upon the night of AllhollonEuen last, she was accompanied as well withthe persons aforesaid, as also with a greatmany other witches, to the number of two hundredth:and that all they together went by Seaeach one in a Riddle or Ciue, and went in the same very substantially with Flagons of winemaking merry and drinking by the way in the same Riddles or Ciues, to the Kirk of NorthBarrick in Lowthian, and that after they hadlanded, took hands on the land and dauncedthis reill or short dance, singing all with onevoice.[pg 093]Commer go ye before, commer go ye,If ye will not go before, commer let me.At which time she confessed, that this GeillesDuncane did go before them playing this reillor dance upon a small Trump, called a IewesTrump, until they entered into the Kirk of northBarrick.These confessions made the King in a woderfuladmiration, and sent for the said Geillis Duncan,who upon the like Trump did play thesaid dance before the Kings Majesty, who inrespect of the strangeness of these matters, tookegreat delight to bee present at their examinations.Item, the said Agnis Tompson confessed thatthe Devil being then at North Barrick Kerkeattending their coming in the habit or likenesof a man, and seeing that they tarried over long,he at their coming enjoined them all to a penance,which was, that they should kiss hisButtockes, in sign of duty to him: which beingput over the Pulpit bar, every one did ash had enjoined them: and having made his vngodlyexhortations, wherein he did greatly enveigheagainst the King of Scotland, he receiuedtheir oaths for their good and true seruicetowards him, and departed: which done, theyreturned to Sea, and so home again.[pg 094]At which time the witches demanded of theDiuel why he did bear such hatred to the King,who answered, by reason the King is the greatestenemy he hath in the world: all which theirconfessions and depositions are still extant vponrecord.Item, the said Agnis Simpson confessed beforethe Kings Majesty sundry things whichwere so miraculous and strange, as that hisMaiestie said they were all extreme liars,whereat she answered, she would not wish hisMaiestie to suppose her words to be false, butrather to believe them, in that she would discouersuch matter unto him as his majesty shouldnot any way doubt off.And thereupon taking his Majesty a little aside,she declared unto him the very woordeswhich passed between the Kings Majesty andhis Queen at Vpslo in Norway the first nightof their marriage, with their answer each to other:whereat the Kings Majesty wonderedgreatlye, and swore by the living God, that hebeleeued that all the Devils in hell could nothaue discovered the same: acknowledging herwoords to be most true, and therefore gave themore credit to the rest which is before declared.Touching this Agnis Tompson, she is the onlyewoman, who by the Devils perswasionshould have intended and put in execution the[pg 095]Kings Majesties death in this manner.She confessed that she took a black Toad,and did hang the same up by the heals, threedaies, and collected and gathered the venom asset dropped and fell from it in an Oyster shell, andkept the same venom close covered, until sheshould obtain any part or piece of foul linnencloth, that had appertained to the Kings Majesty,as shirt, handkercher, napkin or any otherthing which she practised to obtain by meanesof one Iohn Cares, who being attendant in hisMaiesties Chamber, desired him for old acquaintancebetweene them, to help her to oneor a piece of such a cloth as is aforesaid, whichthing the said Iohn Cares denied to help her too,saying he could not help her too it.And the said Agnis Tompson by her depositionssince her apprehension saith, that if she hadobtained any one piece of linen cloth which theKing had worn and fouled, she had bewitchedhim to death, and put him to such extraordinarypaines, as if he had been lying upon sharp thornesand ends of Needles.Moreover she confessed that at the time whenhis Majesty was in Denmark, she being accompaniedwith the parties before specially named,took a Cat and christened it, and afterwardbound to each part of that Cat, the cheefestpartes of a dead man, and several joints of[pg 096]his body, and that in the night following thesaide Cat was conveyed into the midst of the seaby all these witches sailing in their riddles orCiues as is aforesaid, and so left the said Catright before the Town of Lies in Scotland:this done, there did arise such a tempest in theSea, as a greater hath not been seen: whichtempest was the cause of the perishing of aBoate or vessel coming over from the towneof Brunt Island to the town of Lies, whereinwas sundry Jewels and rich gifts, whichshould have been presented to the now Queen ofScotland, at her Majesties coming to Lies.Again it is confessed, that the said christenedCat was the cause that the Kings MaiestiesShip at his coming forth of Denmark, hada contrary wind to the rest of his Ships, thenbeing in his company, which thing was moststrange and true, as the Kings Majesty acknowledges,for when the rest of the Shippeshad a fair and good wind, then was the windecontrarye and altogether against his Majesty:and further the said witch declared, that hisMaiestie had never come safely from the Sea,if his faith had not prevailed above their intentions.Moreover the said Witches being demanded[pg 097]how the Devil would use them when hues in their company, they confessed that whenthe Devil did receive them for his servants, andthat they had vowed themselves unto him, thenhe would Carnally use them, albeit to their littlepleasure, in respect of his cold nature: andwould doo the like at sundry other times.As touching the aforesaid Doctor Feign, aliasIohn Cunningham, the examination of his actessince his apprehension, declares the great subtiltyeof the devil, and therefore makes thingesto appear the more miraculous: for being apprehendedby the accusation of the said GeillisDuncane aforesaid, who confessed he was theirRegester, and that there was not one man sufferedto come to the Devils readinges but onlyehe: the said Doctor was taken and imprisoned,and used with the accustomed pain, prouidedfor those offences, inflicted upon the rest as is aforesaid.First by thrawing of his head with a rope,whereat he would confess nothing.Secondly, he was persuaded by fair meansto confess his follies, but that would prevails little.Lastly he was put to the most severe and cruellpaine in the world, called the boots, who after[pg 098]he had received three strokes, being enquiredif he would confess his damnable acts and wickedlife, his tongue would not serve him to speak,in respect whereof the rest of the witches willedto search his tongue, under which was found twopinnes thrust up into the head, whereuponthe witches did lay, Now is the Charmestinted, and showed that those charmed Pinneswere the cause he could not confess any thing:then was he immediately released of the boots,brought before the King, his confession was taken,and his own hand willingly set ther-vnto,which contained as follows.First, that at the general meetings of thosewitches, he was always preasent: that hues Clarke to all those that were in subiectionto the Devils service, bearing the name of witches,that always he did take their oaths fortheir true service to the Devil, and that he wrotfor them such matters as the Devil still pleasedto command him.Item, he confessed that by his witchcraft hedid bewitch a Gentleman dwelling near to theSaltpans, where the said Doctor kept School,only for being enamoured of a Gentlewomanwhome he loved himself: by means of which[pg 099]his Sorcery, witchcraft and devilish practises,he caused the said Gentleman that once in xxiiij.hours he fell into a lunacy and madness, and socontinued one whole hour together, and for theveritie of the same, he caused the Gentleman tobe brought before the Kings Majesty, whichwas upon the xxiiij. day of December last, andbeing[pg 100]in his Majesties Chamber, suddenly he gave agreat scritch and fell into a madness, sometimebending himself, and sometime capering so directlyvp, that his head did touch the seeling of theChamber, to the great admiration of his Maiestieand others then present: so that all the Gentlemenin the Chamber were not able to holdehim, until they called in more help, who togetherbound him hand and foot: and suffering thesaid gentleman to lye still until his fury werepast, he within an hour came again to himself,when being demanded of the Kings Maiestiewhat he saw or did all that while, answeredthat he had been in a sound sleep.Item the said Doctor did also confess that hehad used means sundry times to obtain his purposeand wicked intent of the same Gentlewoman,and seeing himself disappointed of his intention,he determined by all ways he might toobtaine the same, trusting by conjuring, witchcraftand Sorcery to obtain it in this manner.It happened this gentlewoman being unmarried,had a brother who went to school with thesaid Doctor, and calling his Scholar to him,demanded if he did lye with his sister, who answers did, by means whereof he thought toobtaine his purpose, and therefore secretly promisedto teach him without stripes, so he would obtainfor him three hairs of his sisters privities,[pg 101]at such time as he should spy best occasion forit: which the youth promised faithfully to perform,and vowed speedily to put it in practise,taking a piece of conjured paper of his maisterto lap them in when he had gotten them: andtherevpon the boy practised nightly to obtainehis masters purpose, especially when his sisterwas a sleep.But God who knows the secrets of allharts, and reveals all wicked and vngodlyepractises, would not suffer the intents of this diuilishDoctor to come to that purpose which hesupposed it would, and therefore to declare thathe was heavily offended with his wicked intent,did so work by the Gentlewoman's ownemeanes, that in the end the same was discoueredand brought to light: for she being one nighta sleep, and her brother in bed with her, suddenlyecryed out to her mother, declaring that herBrother would not suffer her to sleep, wherevponher mother having a quick capacity, did vehementlysuspect Doctor Fians intention, by reasonshe was a witch of her self, and thereforepresently arose, and was very inquisitive of theboy to understand his intent, and the better toknow the same, did beat him with sundry stripes,whereby he discovered the truth unto her.[pg 102]The Mother therefore being well practisedin witchcraft, did think it most conuenientto meet with the Doctor in his own Art, andtherevpon took the paper from the boy, whereinhee should have put the same hairs, andwent to a young Heifer which never had borneCalfe nor gone to the Bull, and with a pair ofsheeres, clipped off three hairs from the vdderof the Cow, and wrapped them in the same paper,which she again delivered to the boy, thenwilling him to give the same to his said Master,which he immediately did.The Schoolmaster so soon as he had receiuedthem, thinking them indeed to bee theMaides hairs, went straight and wroughthis art upon them: But the Doctor had no soonerdoone his intent to them, but presently theHayfer or Cow whose hairs they were indeed,came unto the door of the Church whereinthe Schoolmaster was, into the which theHayfer went, and made towards the Schoolmaster,leaping and dancing upon him, andfollowing him forth of the church and to whatplace so ever he went, to the great admirationof all the towns men of Saltpans, and manyother who did behold the same.The report whereof made all men imagine[pg 103]that he did work it by the Devil, withoutwhom it could never have been so sufficientlyeeffected: and thereupon, the name of the said DoctorFian (who was but a very young man) beganto grow so common among the people of Scotland,that he was secretly nominated for a notableCuniurer.[pg 104]All which although in the beginning he denied,and would not confess, yet having felt the pain ofthe boots (and the charm stinted, as aforesaid)he confessed all the aforesaid to be most true, withoutproducing any witnesses to justify the same,& thereupon before the kings majesty he subscribedthe said confessions with his own hand, whichfor truth remains upon record in Scotland.After that the depositions and examinationsof the said doctor Feign Alias Cuningham was taken,as already is declared, with his own handwillingly set thereunto, he was by the master ofthe prison committed to ward, and appointed toa chamber by himself, where forsaking his wickedwayes, acknowledging his most ungodly life,showing that he had too much followed the allurementsand enticements of Satan, and fondly practisedhis conclusions by conjuring, witchcraft, enchantment,sorcery, and such like, he renouncedthe devil and all his wicked works, vowed toleade the life of a Christian, and seemed newlyconnected towards God.The morrow after upon conference had withhim, he granted that the devil had appeared vntohim in the night before, appareled all in black,with a white wand in his hand, and that the devilldemaunded of him if he would continue hisfaithfull service, according to his first oath andpromise made to that effect. Whom (as he then[pg 105]said) he utterly renounced to his face, and saydevnto him in this manner, Avoid Satan, avoid,for I have listened too much unto thee, and by the same thou hast undone me, in respect whereof Ivtterly forsake thee. To whom the devil answered,That once ere thou die thou shall bee mine. Andwith that (as he said) the devil brake the whitewande, and immediately vanished forth of hissight.Thus all the day this Doctor Feign continuedverie solitary, and seemed to have care of hisowne soul, and would call upon God, shewinghimselfe penitent for his wicked life, neuerthelessethe same night he found such means, that heestole the key of the prison door and chamber inthe which he was, which in the night he openedand fled away to the Salt pans, where he wasalwayes resident, and first apprehended. Ofwhose sudden departure when the Kings maiestiehad intelligence, he presently commanded diligentinquirie to bee made for his apprehension,and for the better effecting thereof, he sent publikeproclamations into all parts of his landeto the same effect. By means of whose hot andharde pursuit, he was again taken and broughtto prison, and then being called before the kingshighnes, he was reexamined as well touchinghis departure, as also touching all that had beforehappened.[pg 106]But this Doctor, notwithstanding that hisowne confession appears remaining in recordevnder his own hand writing, and the sametherevnto fixed in the presence of the Kings maiestieand sundry of his Council, yet did he vtterlydenie the same.Whereupon the kings majesty perceiuinghis stubborn wilfulness, concerned and imaginedthat in the time of his absence he had enteredinto new conference and league with the devillhis master, and that he had been again newlymarked, for the which he was narrowly searched,but it could not in any wise bee found, yetfor more trial of him to make him confess, heewas commanded to have a most strange tormentwhich was done in this manner following.His nails upon all his fingers were riuen andpulled off with an instrument called in Scottisha Turks, which in England wee call a pair ofpincers, and under every nail there was thrustin two needels over even up to the heads. At allwhich torments notwithstanding the Doctorneuer shronke any whit, neither would he thenconfesse it the sooner for all the tortures inflictedvpon him.Then was he with all convenient speed, bycommandement, conveyed again to the torment[pg 107]of the boots, wherein he continued a longtime, and did abide so many blows in them,that his legs were crushed and beaten togeatheras small as might bee, and the bones andflesh so bruised, that the blood and marrow spoutedforth in great abundance, whereby they weremade unseruiceable for ever. And notwithstandingal these grievous pains and cruel tormentshee would not confess any thing, so deeply hadthe devil entered into his heart, that he vtterlydenied all that which he had before avouched,and would say nothing thereunto but this, thatwhat he had done and said before, was onelydone and said for fear of pains which he hadendured.Upon great consideration therefore taken bythe Kings majesty and his Council, as well forth due execution of justice upon such detestablemalefactors, as also for example sake, to remain terror to all others hereafter, that shall attemptto deal in the like wicked and vngodlyeactions, as witchcraft, sorcery, cuniuration, & suchlike, the said Doctor Feign was soon after arraigned,condemned, and adjudged by the law to die,and then to bee burned according to the law ofthat land, provided in that behalf. Wherevponhee was put into a carte, and being first strangled,he was immediately put into a great fire,being ready provided for that purpose, and there[pg 108]burned in the Castle hill of Edenbrough on a saterdaiein the end of January last past. 1591.The rest of the witches which are not yet executed,remain in prison till farther trial, andknowledge of his majesties pleasure.This strange discourse before recited, may perhapsgiue some occasion of doubt to such as shall happen toreade the same, and thereby conjecture that the Kingsmaiestie would not hazard himself in the presenceof such notorious witches, least thereby might have insuedgreat danger to his person and the general stateof the land, which thing in truth might well have benefeared. But to answer generally to such, let this suffice:that first it is well known that the King is the child &servant of God, and they but servants to the devil, heeis the Lords anointed, and they but vessels of Godswrath: he is a true Christian, and trusts in God, theyworse than Infidels, for they only trust in the devil,who daily serve them, till he have brought them to vtterdestruction. But hereby it seems that his Highnessecarted a magnanimous and undaunted mind, notfeared with their enchantments, but resolute in this,that so long as God is with him, he fears not whois against him. And truly the whole scope of this treatisedooth so plainly lay open the wonderful prouidenceof the Almighty, that if he had not been defendedby his omnipotence and power, his Highneshad never returned alive in his voyage fr?? Denmark,so that there is no doult but God would as well defendhim on the land as on the sea, where they pretendedtheir damnable practise.FINIS."
