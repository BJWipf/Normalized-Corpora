THE LANCASHIRE-WITCHES AND TONGUE ODIVELLY, THE IRISH-PRIEST
PROLOGUE.
OUR Poet once resolved to quit the stage,
But seeing what slight Plays still please the Age
He is drawn in: And thinks to pass with ease,
He cannot write so ill •s some that please.
Our Author says he has no need to fear,
〈…〉
The common Eyes all paintings please •like,
〈…〉
Instruction is an honest Poets aim,
And not a large or wide, but a goo• 〈◊〉▪
But he has found long since this would not do,
And therefore thought to have deserted you:
But Poets and Young Girls by no mishaps
Are warned, those damming fright not, nor these 〈◊〉▪
Their former I•tch will spite of all persuade,
And both will fall again to their old trade:
Our Poet says that some resolve in spite
To damn, th•' good, what ever he shall write.
He fears not such as right or wrong oppose,
He swears, in sense, his friends out weigh such foe•s.
He cares not much whether he sink or 〈◊〉,
He will not suffer, but we shall for him.

Your charity for this Crippled peace we pray
We are only losers if you damn the play

THE Lancashire Witches AND TEGVE O DIVELLY THE Irish PRIEST.

ACT. I.
Enter Sir Edward Harfort and Smirk.
Smirk.
SIR, give me leave, as by my duty bound,
To let you know (though I am lately come
Into your Family) I have observed
(For all your real courtesy, and seeming mirth
Among your Friends that visit you) a fixed
And constant melancholy does possess you, Sir,
When you're alone, and you seem not to relish
The happiness your ample fortune, and
The great esteem your worth has ever gained
From all good men might give you, I am bound
To inquire the Cause, and offer my Advice.
Sir Adieu.
Pray search no further, I, for once, can pardon
The rashness of your curiosity.
I did not take you for my Councellor.
Smirk.
You now, Sir, are become one of my Flock:
And I am bound in Conscience to Advise,

And search into the troubles of your spirit,
To find the secrets that disturb your mind.
Sir Adieu.
I do not wonder that a Parson should
Be foolish and pragmatical; but know,
I will advise and teach your Master of Artship
(That made you lord it over Boys and Fr•shmen)
To add to y•ur small Logic and Divinity
Two main Ingredi•nts, Sir, Sense and Good-manners,
Smirk.
Consider, Sir, the Dignity of my Func•ion.
Sir Adieu.
Your Father is my Taylor, you are my Servant.
And d• you think a Cassock and a Girdle
Can 〈◊〉 you so much, as to enable
You (who before were but a Coxcomb, Sir,)
To t•ach me? Know, I only took you for
A me•hanick ••vine, to read Church Prayers
Twice every day, and once a week to Teach
My Servants Honesty and Obedience.
You may 〈◊〉 to a silly Flock,
And leadem where you please, but no•re must hope
To govern men of sense and knowledge.
Smirk.
My Office bids me say this is profane,
And little less than Athiestical.
Sir Adieu.
You're insolent, you're one of the senseless,
H•theaded Fools, that injure all your Tribe;
Learn of the wise, the moderate and good,
Our Church abounds with such examples for you.
I 〈◊〉 the name of Atheist, you•re ill-manner•d.
But who ere touches one of you hot-spur Parsons,
You brand him home, and right, or wrong, no matter.
Smirk.
My Orders give me Authority to speak.
Sir Adieu.
Your Orders separate, and set you apart
To Minister, That is to serve in Churches,
And not to domino•r in Families.
Smirk.
A p•were Legantine I have from Heaven.
Sir Adieu.
Show your Credentials. Come good petulant
Mr. 〈◊〉-L•gick, pack up your for Books
And •lt Black thred-bare Clothes to morrow-morning,
And have my House; get you a Wall-ey•d Mare,
Will carry double, for your Spouse and you;
When some •ast Chamber-Maid shall smile upon you,
Charmed with a Vic•aridge of forty pound
A year, the greatest you can 〈…〉.
Smirk.
Good Sir! I have offended, and am sorry.
I 〈◊〉 will once c•mmit this fault again,
Now I am acquainted with your Worships mind▪



Sir Adieu.
So, now you are not bound in Conscience then.
The indiscretion of such paltry fellows
Are scandals to the Church and Cause they Preach for.
What fatal mi•chiefs have domestic Priests
Brought on the best of Families in England!
Where their dull Patrons give them line enough,
First with the Women they insinuate,
(Whose fear and folly makes them slaves t'you,)
And give them ill opinions of their Husbands.
Oft ye divide them if the women rule not.
But, if they govern, then your reign is sure.
Then y' have the secrets of the Family,
Dispose of the Children, place and then displace,
Whom, and when you think fit.
Smirk.
Good, Noble Sir! I humbly shall desist.
Sir Adieu.
The Husband must not drink a Glass, but when
You shall, of your good grace, think fit for him.
None shall be welcome but whom you approve:
And all this favour is, perhaps, requited
With the infusing of ill principles into the Sons,
And stealing, or corrupting of the Daughters.
Sometimes upon a weak and bigot Patron you
Obtain so much to be Executor:
And, if he dies, marry his Widow, and
Claim then the cheating of his Orphans too.
Smirk.
Sweet Sir forbear, I am fully sensible.
Sir Adieu.
With furious zeal you press for Discipline,
With fire and blood maintain your great Diana.
Foam at the mouth when a Dissenter's named,
(With fiery eyes, wherein we flaming see
A persecuting spirit) you roar at
Those whom the wisest of your function strive
To win by gentleness and easy ways.
You dam em if they do not love a Surplice.
Smirk.
Had I the power, I'd make them wear pitched Surplices,
And light them till they flamed about their Ears
I would—
Sir Adieu.
Such Firebrands as you but hurt the Cause.
The learned and the wisest of your Tribe
Strive by good life and meekness to overcome them.
We serve a Prince renowned for Grace and Mercy,
Abhorring ways of Blood and Cruelty;
Whose Glory will, for this, last to all Ages.
Him Heaven preserve long quiet in his Throne.
I will have no such violent Sons of Thunder,


I will have moderation in my House.
Smirk.
Forgive my zeal, and, if your Worship please,
I will submit to all your wise Instructions.
Sir Adieu.
Then (on your good behaviour) I receive you,
Search not the secrets of my House or me.
Vain was our Reformation, if we still
Suffer auricular Confession here,
By which the Popish Clergy rule the world.
No business in my Family shall concern you;
Preach nothing but good life and honesty.
Smirk.
I will not.
Sir Adieu.
No controversial Sermons will I hear:
No meddling with Government; you're ignorant
〈◊〉 Laws and Customs of cur Realm, and should be so.
The other world should be your care, not this.
A Ploughmen is as fit to be a Pilot,
As a good Clergy-man to be a States-man, Sir,
Besides, the People are not apt to love you,
Because your sloth is supported by their labours.
And you do hurt to any Cause you would
Advance.
Smirk.
I humbly bow, Sir, to your Wisdom.
Sir Adieu.
A meek and humble modest Teacher be;
For piteous tri•les you Divines fall out.
If you must Quarrel, Quarrel who shall be
Most honest men; leave me, and then consider
Of what I have said.
Smirk.
I will do any thing,
Rather than lose your Worships grace and favour.
Sir Adieu.
Begone.
Ex. Smirk▪
Enter Isabella.
Isabella.
Sir, why do you walk alone, and Melancholy?
I have observed you droop much on the sudden.
Sir Adieu.
Dear Isabella, the most solid joy
And comfort of my fading life! thou truest Image
Of thy dead Mother! who excel•d her Sex:
Fair, and not proud on it; witty, and not vain;
Not grave, but Wise; Chaste, and yet kind and free;
Devout, not sower; Religious, not precise:
In her no foolish affectation was
Which makes us na•seat all good qualities.
She was all meekness and humility;
The tenderest Mother, and the softest Wife.



Isab.
My Dearest and most Honoured Father,
(Had you not been the best of Parents living)
I could not have outlived that Mothers loss:
Loss of her tender care, and great example.
Sir Adieu.
Yet learn, my Child, never to grieve for that
Which cannot be recalled; those whom I love
With tenderness I will embrace, when living,
And when they're dead strive to forget 'em soon.
Isab.
What is it can afflict you now, dear Father?
Sir Adieu.
You're wise, to thee I can declare my grief;
Thy Brother has been still my tender care,
Out of my duty, rather than affection,
Whom I could never bend by education
To any generous purpose, who delights
In Dogs and Horses, Peasants, Ale and Sloth.
Isab.
He may have Children will be wiser, Sir.
And you are young enough yet to expect
Many years comfort in your Grandchildren.
Sir Adieu.
To that end, I would match the unhewn Clown
To the fair Daughter of Sir Ieffery Shaklehead,
Who has all the perfections can be wished
In women•n-kind, and might restore the breed:
But he neglects her to enjoy his Clowns,
His foolish sports, and is averse to Marriage.
I would not have my name perish in him.
Isab.
aside.
I am sure she'll never help to the continuance.
Sir Adieu.
But thou art good, my Child, obedient,
And though Sir Timothy, Sir Ieffery's Son,
Has not the great accomplishments I wish him,
His temper yet is flexible and kind,
And will be apt to yield to thy discretion.
His person not ungratious, his Estate
Large, and lies altogether about his House,
Which (for its situation and its building)
With noble Gardens, Fountains, and a River
Running quite through his Park and Garden,
Exceeds most in the North: Thou know my Child
How this cross match will strengthen and advance
My Family—He is coming hither from
His sport, He has given his Horse to his man, and now▪
Is walking towards us; I'll go and find
My Lady and her Daughter.
Ex. Sir Edward.
Isab.
Oh hard fate!
That I must disobey so good a Father:


I to no punishment can be condemned
Like to the Marriage with this foolish Knight.
But by ill usage of him, I will make him,
I• possible, hate me as I hate him.
Enter Sir Timothy Shaklehead.
Sir Tim.
Oh my Fair Cousin, I spy•d ye, and that made me give my man my Horse to come to you.

Isab.
Me? have you any business with me?

Sir Tim.
Business! yes Faith, I think I have, you know it well enough, but we have had no sport this afternoon, and therefore I made hast to come to you.

Is•b.
Such as you should have no sport made to you, you should make it for others.

Sir Tim.
Ay, its no matter for that; but Cousin, would you believe it, we were all 〈◊〉, Mother Demdike and all her Imps were abroad, I think, but you are the pr•tty 〈◊〉 that enchants my heart. This must n••ds please her.

Aside.
Isab.
Well said, Academy of Compliments, you are well read I see.

Sir Tim.
Odds Bud, who would have thought she had read that!

Isab.
Nay, for Learning and good breeding let Tim alone.

Sir Tim.
Tim! I might be Sir Timothy in your mouth though one would think.

Isab.
I am sorry the King bestowed Honour so cheaply.

Sir Tim.
Nay, not so cheap neither; for though my Lady Mother had a dear Friend at Court, yet I was fain to give one a Hundred pounds, besides my Fees, I am sure of that: Tim, hum go too—

I•ab.
Was there ever so fulsome a Fool▪

Sir Tim.
Besides, I gave Thirty Guinnies for the Sword I was Knighted with to one of his Nobles, for the King di• not draw his own Sword upon me.

Isab.
Do you abuse the Nobility? would a Nobleman sell you a Sword?

Sir Tim.
Yes that they will, s•ll that or any thing else at Court. I am sure he was a great Courtier he talked so prettily to the Kings Dogs, and was so familiar with them, and they were very kind to 〈◊〉, and he had great interest in them: He had all their names as quick, and 〈…〉 know who, and discourse•d with them, I protest and vow, as if they had 〈◊〉 Christians.

Isab.
Oh thou art a pretty F•llow; hey for little Tim of Lancashire.

Sir Tim.
You might give one on•s title one would think, I say again, especially one that loves you too.

Isab.
Yes, I will give you your Title.

Sir Tim.
Thank you dear Co•z•n.

He offers to kiss her hand, she gives him a box on the ear.
Isab.
Take that, and your proper Title, Fool.

Sir Tim.
Fool! I 〈◊〉 you, I s•orn your words, it is a burning shame you should be 〈◊〉, th•t it is: Little think my •eddy Mother how I am used.

I••b.
Once for all, as a Kinsman I w•ll b• civil to you; but if you dare make love 〈◊〉, I'll make thee such an example, thou shalt be a terror to all foolish Knights.

Sir Tim.
•oolish! ha, ha, ha, that's a pretty jest; why have not I been at Oxford and the 〈◊〉 of Court? I have spent my time well indeed if I be a Fool still: But I am not such a Fool to give you over for all this.



Isab.
Dost thou hear? thou most incorrigible lump, never to be licked into form; thou Coxcomb incarnate; thou fresh, insipid, witless, mannerless Knight, who wear a Knighthood worse than a Haberdasher of Small wares would; It serves but to make thy folly more eminent.

Sir Tim.
Well, well, forsooth, somebody shall know this.

Isab.
Every one that knows thee knows it. Dost thou think, because thy foolish Mother has Cocker•d thee with morning Cawdles and afternoons Luncheons, thou art fit to make Love? Isle use thee like a Dog if thou dare but speak once more of Love, or name the world before me.

Sir Tim.
Mum, mum, no more to be said, I shall be heard some-where. Will your Father maintain you in these things, ha Gentlewoman?

Isab.
Tell if thou durst, I'll make thee tremble. Heart, if you bent gone now presently, Isle beat you.

Ex. Sir Tim.
Enter Theodosia.
Isab.
My Dear, art thou come! I have been just now tormented by thy foolish Brothers awkward Courtship, forgive me that I make so bold with him.

Theo.
Prithee do, my Dear, I shall be as free with thine, though he is not so great a Plague, for he is bashful, very indifferent, and for ought I perceive, to my great com∣fort, no Lover at all: But mine is pert, foolish, confident, and on my Conscience in love to boot.

Isab.
Well, we are resolved never to Marry where we are designed, that•s certain. For my part I am a free English woman, and will stand up for▪ my Liberty, and Pro∣perty of Choice.

Theo.
And Faith, Girl, Isle be a mutineer on thy side; I hate the imposition of a Husband, it is as bad as Pop•rye.

Isab.
We will be Husband and Wife to one another, dear Theodosia.

Theo.
But there are a brace of Sparks we saw at the Spew, I am apt to believe would forbid the Banes if they were here.

Isab.
Bellfort and D•ubt• they write us word they will be here suddenly, but I have little hopes; for my Father is so resolved in whatever he proposes, I must despair of his consent for Bellfort, though he is too reasonable to force me to Marry any one▪ besides he is engaged, in honour, to your Father.

Theo.
Nay, if thou think of subjection still, or I either, we are in a desperate case: No, mutiny, mutiny, I say.

Isab.
And no money, no money will our Fathers say.

Theo.
If our Lovers will not take us upon those Terms they are not worthy of us. If they will, farewell Daddy, say I.

Isab.
If so, I will be as hearty a Rebel, and as brisk as thou art for thy life; But can thou think they are such Romance Knights to take Ladies with nothing? I am scarce so vain though I am a woman.

Theo.
I would not live without vanity for the Earth; if every one could see their own faults it would be a sad World.



••ab.
Thou say right, sure the world would be almost depopulated, most men •old hang themselves.

The•.
Ay, and women too: Is there any creature so happy as your affected Lady? or 〈◊〉 Coxcomb?

I•ab.
I must confess they have a happy error, that serves their turn better than truth; but away with Philosophy, and let's walk on and consider of the more weighty mat∣ters of our Love.

〈◊〉.
Come along my Dear.

Ex▪ Isabella and Theodocia.
Enter Sir Timothy.
Sir Tim.
What a pox is the matter? She has pissed upon a Nettle to day, or else the Witch•s have b•witched h•r. Hah, now I talk of Witches, I am plag•oily afraid, and all alone: No here is Nun••e Tomas.

Enter Tho. Shaklehead.
T•• Sha.
How now Cousin?

Sir Tim.
Cousin? plain Cousin? You might have more manners Uncle, S flesh, and one gives you an Inch, you'll take an Ell. I see Familiarity breeds Contempt.

T•m Sha.
Well, Sir Timothy, then, Bier Lady I thought no harm; But I am your 〈…〉 that.

Sir Tim.
Yes, my Father's younger Brother. What a Murrain do we keep you for, but to have an eye over our Dogs and Hawks, to drink Ale with the Tenants (when they come with R•ned or •resents) in Black Jacks, at the upper end of a Brown Shoe•••board •able in the Hal•? to sit at lower end of the board at meals, rise make •our 〈◊〉, and take away your Plate at second Course? And you to be thus familiar!

T•m Sha.
Pray forgive me good Cousin: Sir Timothy, I mean.

Sir Tim.
V•rye well, you will be fa•cy again Uncle. Uds lord, Why was I Knight∣ed but to have my Title given me? My Father, and Lady Mother can give it me, and s••h a Fellow as you, a mere younger Brother to forget it.

T•m Sha.
Nay, nay, ha•d ye yeou mun tat in good part, I did but forget a bit, good Sir Timo•hy.

Sir Tim.
My Mother would 〈◊〉 a fine taking about it, and she knew it.

T•m Sha.
Nay, pray now do not 〈…〉 my •eddy, by the Mass who'l be even 〈◊〉 wood an who hears o•t. But look a, look a, here come the Caursers, the Har• 〈◊〉 played the D••l with us to 〈◊〉, we 〈…〉 bewitched.

Sir Tim.
Ay, so we have, to have the Hare vanish in open Field before all our fa∣•••, and our eyes never 〈◊〉 from her.

T•m Sha.
Ay, and then an old wife (they caw'n her Mother Demdike) to start 〈…〉 very spot o grant where we losten puss!




Enter Sir Ieffery Shaklehead, Sir Edward Harf•urt, young Harfourt, Chaplain, Clod, and other Servants.
Sir Adieu.
These are Prodigies you tell, they cannot be; your senses are deceived.

Sir Ieff.
My senses deceived! that's well, Is there a Justice in Lancashire has so much skill in Witches as I have? Nay, I'll speak a proud word, you shall turn me loose a∣against any Witch-finder in Europe; I'd make an Ass of Hopkins if he were alive.

Young Har.
Nay, I'll swear it is true, a Pox on that old Carrion Mother Demdike, she he's mar•d all our sports, and almost killed Two Brace of Greyhounds worth a Thou∣sand pound.

Sir Adieu.
Dreams, mere Dreams of Witches, old women's fables, the Devil's not such a Fool as you would make him.

Sir Ieff.
Dreams! mercy upon me! are you so profane to deny Witches?

Smirk.
Heaven defend! will you deny the existence of Witches? It is very Athe∣istical.

Sir Adieu.
Incorrigible ignorance! it is such as you are Atheistical, that would equal the Devils power with that of Heaven its self. I see such simple Parsons cannot en∣dure to hear the Devil dishonoured.

Sir Ieff.
No Witches? why I have hanged above Fourscore. Read Bodin, Remigi∣us, Delrio, Nider, Instead•r, Sprenger, Godelman, and More, and Malleus Maleficarum, a great Author, that Writes sweetly about Witches, very sweetly.

Sir Adieu.
Malleus Maleficarum a Writer, he has read nothing but the titles I see.

Sir Ieff.
Oh I a great man, Malleus was a great man; Read Cousin, read the An∣tidote against Atheism: Well, I'll make work among your Witches.

Young Har.
Ay good Sir Ieffery do, Uds Lord they'll grow so bold one shan• go a Coursing, Hunting or Hawking for 'em one of these days; and then all the joy of ones life's gone.

Sir Adieu.
Why are those all the joys of Life?

Young Har.
Ay Godsflesh are they, I'd not give a Farthing to live with out 'em, what's a Gentleman but his Sports.

Tho. Sha.
Nay, bier Lady, I mun have a saup of Ale now and then, besides sports.

Sir Ieff.
Why here's my Son, Sir Timothy, saw the Hare vanish, and the Witch ap∣pear.

Sir Tim.
That I did upon my Honour Sir Ieffery.

Enter Clod.
Clod.
So ho, here's the Hare again.

Young Har.
He Boys, loo on the Dogs, more sport, more sport.

Sir Adieu.
It is almost dark, let's home: go to your Mistress, Fool.

Young Har.
Time enough for that, Sir, I must have this Course first, hello.

They all go out as to Coursing.


Mother Demdike rises •ut of the ground as they re-enter.
Sir Ieff.
Now, Sir Edward, do you see, the Hare is vanished, and here is the Hag.

Sir Adieu.
Yes, I see it is almost dark, the Hare is run from your tired Dogs, and here is a poor old Woman gathering of sticks.

Smirk.
Avaunt thou filthy Hag, I defy thee and all thy works.

•lod.
This is wheint indeed Sir, you are a Scholar, pray defend me.

Sir Ieff.
Now you shall see how the Witches fear me.

Sir Adieu.
The old women ha•• reason to fear you, you have hanged so many of 'em.

Sir Ieff.
Now Tom Shaklehead, and you Clod, lay hold of the Witch quickly; now you shall see my skill, we'll search her, I warrant she has bags or •eats a handful long about her parts that shall be name•less; then we•l have her wa•c•ed e•light and forty hours, and pricked with Needles, to keep her from sleeping, and make her 〈◊〉, Gad •he will confess any thing in the world then; and if nor, after all, wee•l tie her Thumbs and great Toes together and 〈◊〉 her into your great Pond. Let me alone with her, I warrant ye, come, come, come, where are you?

Sir Adieu.
So I must have a poor old woman murdered in my House.

Mother Demdike knocks down Tom Shakle▪ head and Clod and vanishes.
Tom. Sha. Clod.
Oh the Witch, the Devil.

Sir Ieff.
How now, whats the matter?

Tom Sha.
Why by'r Lady, the De•ls in the matter, the old Hag has knocked us both dawn, and is vanished under grant I think.

Sir Adieu.
Your fear has knocked you down, and the old woman has escaped.

Sir Ieff.
No, no, she has done it; a Witch has a mighty strength: Six men are not strong enough for a Witch of Fourscore.

Sir Adieu.
Come prethy, Sir Ieffery, let's home and drive these fables out of her heads, its dark.

Sir Ieff.
Nay, I know how to deal with her, I•le send my Warrant, and a Consta∣ble with that is strong enough to beat six Witches, ay, six the ablest Witches on 'em all•you'd wonder at it, but faith it is true.

Exeunt omnes.
Mother Demdike re-enters.
Damned.
Ha, ha, ha, how I have fooled these fellows, let 'em go home and prate a∣bout it, this night we'll revel in Sir Edward's Cellar, and laugh at the Justice. But to the business of the Night.

She sings.
Come, Sisters, come, why do you stay?
Our business will not brook delay,
[a] The Owl is flown from the hollow Oak.
From Lakes and Bogs the Toads do croak.
The Foxes bark, the Screetch-Owl screams:
Wolves howl, Bats fly, and the faint beams



O• Glow-worms light grows bright apace;
The Stars are fled, the Moon hides her face.
[b] The Spindle now is turning round:
[c] Mandrakes are groaning under ground.
[d] •the hole in the Ditch, (our Nails have made)
[e] Now all our Images are laid,
Of Wax and Wool, which we must[f] prick,
With Needles urging to the quick▪
[g] Into the hole I•le pour a flood
Of Black Lambs blood, to make all good.
The Lamb with Nails and Teeth wee•l tear.
Come wheres the Sacrifice? appear.
Enter Mother Dickinson, Hargrave, Mal, Spencer, and several other Witches with a Black Lamb.
Witches.
•It is here.
Damned.
Why are you all so tardy grown?
Must I the work perform alone?
Dicken,
[h] Be patient Dame, we'll all obey.
Them.
Come then to work, anon we'll play.
To yonder Hall
Our Lord Weel call,
Sing, dance and eat,
Play many a feat,
And fright the Justice and the Squire,
And plunge the Cattle into the Mire.
But now to work
They tear the Black Lamb in pieces and pour the Blood into the hole.
[i] Debar, Debar, do not Stay,
Upon the Waves go sport and play▪
And see the ship be Cast away.
Come let us now our parts perform,
And Scrape a hole, and raise a Storm.
Dicken.
[k] Here is some Sea Sand I have Gotten,
Which thus into the Air I Throw.
Harg.
Here's sage, that under ground was rotten,
Which thus around me I bestow.
Spencer.
Sticks on the Bank across are laid.
Harg.
The hole by our nails is almost made.
Hogs Bristles boil within the Pot.
Damned.
The Hollow flint Stone I have Got,


Which I over my Shoulder throw,
Into the west, to make winds blow.
Now water here, and urine put,
And with your Sty•ks stir it about.
Now dip your brooms, and toss them high,
To bring the Rain down from the Sky.
Not yet a Storm?[l] Come let us wound
The Air with every dreadful sound,[m]
And with live vipers beat the ground.
They beat the ground with Vipers, they bark, ho•l, hiss, cry like Screetch-Owles, hollow like Owls, and make many confused noises: The Storm begins.

Song of three parts.
NOw the winds roar▪
And the Skies Pour
Down all their Store.
It Thunders and Lightens.
And now the Nights black,
Hark how the Clouds crack.
Hark how the Clouds crack.
It Thunders and Lightens.
A hollow din the Woods now make,
The Valleys tremble, Mountains Shake,
And all the living Creatures quake.
It Thunders and Lightens.
It keeps awake the Sleepy fowl,
The Sailors Swear, the high Seas roll,
And all the frighted Dogs do howl.
It Thunders and Lightens.
Demdike speaks.
Now to our tasks let's all be gone,
Our Master we shall meet anon,
Between the hours of twelve and one.
They all set up a laugh▪
Enter Clod with a Candle and Lantern.
Clown.
Whew, what a Storm is this! I think Mother Demdike and all her Dee'ls are abroad to neighed, it is so dark too

I canoe see my honed.[*] Oh the Dee'l, the Dee'l,

help! help! this is Mother
Demdike, help, S-lesh,
what m•n I do? I canoe
get dawn, 'swawnds Ayst
be climbed an I stay here awe neighed.



Enter Bellfort and Doubty.
Bell.
Was there ever such a Storm raised on a sudden, the Sky being clear, and no appearance on it before?

Doubt.
But the worst part of our misfortune is to be out of our way in a strange Country, the night so dark that Owls and Bats are weltered.

Bell.
There is is no help, Cover the Saddles, and stand with the Horses under that Tree, while we stand close and shelter our selves here; the Tempest is so violent it cannot last.

Doubt.
Now Philosophy help us to a little patience, Heaven be praised we are not at Sea yet.

Bell.
These troubles we Knight Errants must endure when we march in search of Ladies.

Doubt.
Would we were in as good Lodging as our Dogs have which we sent before to Wholly. I fear too (after all this device of yours) our pretending to hunt here will never take.

Bell.
Why So?

Doubt.
Will any body think that a man in his right wits should choose this Hilly Country to hunt in?

Bell.
O▪ yes, there are Huntsmen that think there's no sport without venturing Necks or Collet-bones; besides, there is no other way to hope to see our Mistresses: by this means we shall troll out my Mistresses Brother, who loves, and understands nothing but Country sports. By that we may get acquaintance with Sir Edward Harfourt, who is reported to be a wise, honest, hospitable, true English man. And that will bring us into Sir Ieffery Shaklehead's family, Wholly being in the mid-way betwixt them.

Doubt.
I am resolved to see my Mistress, what ere comes on•t, and know my doom. Your Yorkshire Spew was a fatal place to me, I lost a heart there, Heaven knows when I shall find it again.

Bell.
Those interviews have spoiled me for a man of this World, I can no more throw of my loose corns of Love upon a Tenants Daughter in the Country, or think of Cuckolding a Keeping Fool in the City; I am grown as pitiful a 〈◊〉 Loving animal as any Romance can furnish us with.

Doubt.
That we should escape in all the Tour of France and Italy, where the 〈◊〉 has power to ripen Love, and catch this distemper in the North! but my Theodosia in humour, wit and beauty has no equal.

Bell.
Besides, my Isabella!

Doubt.
To you your Isabella's equal.

Bell.
We are pretty fellows to talk of Love, we shall be wet to the Skin; yond•r are lights in many Rooms, it must be a great House, let's make towards it.

Doubt.
It is so dark, and among these Hills and Enclosures it is impossible. Will no lucky fellow, of this place, come by and guide us? We are out of all Roads.

Cl•d.
Oh! Oh! what mun Ay do? Ay am well neigh perished: I mun try to get dawn.

He falls.


Help, help, Murder, Murder.
Bell.
What a Devil •s here a fellow fallen from the top of a Tree?

Doubt.
Stead •s tais a night to climb in? what does this mean?

Clod.
Oh! Oh!

Bell.
Here, who art thou? Whats the matter?

Clod.
Oh the Dee•l; avaunt, I defy thee and all thy works.

Doubt.
Is he drunk or mad? give me thy hand, I'll help thee.

Clod.
Begone, Witches I defy ye, help! help.

Bell.
What dost thou talk of? we are no Witches nor Devils, but travellers that have lost our way, and will reward thee well if thou wilt guide us into it.

Clod.
An yeow been a mon Ay'st talk wy ye a bear, yeow mun tack a care o your ••lls, the 〈◊〉 haunted with Buggarts, and Witches, one of 'em took my Condle and I a•thorn out of my honed, and ••ew along wy it; and an other Set me o top o the tree, where I feel dawn naw, Av ha well neigh brocken my theegh.

Doubt.
The fellows mad, I neither understand his words, nor his Sense, prithee •ow far is it to Wholly?

Cl•d.
Why yeow are quite b•said the road mon, yeow Shoulden a gone dawn 〈◊〉 •onk by Thomas o Georges, and then ee'n at yate, and turned dawn the Lone, and 〈◊〉 the Steepo of the reeght •ont.

Bell.
Prithee don't tell us what we should have done, but how far it is to Whalis∣l•y.

Clod.
Why marry four mail and a bit.

Doubt.
We'll give thee an Angel and show us the way thither.

Clod.
Marry that's Whaint I conno see my honed, haw con Ay show yeou to Wholly to neighed.

Bell.
Can thou show us to any house where we may have Shelter and Lodging to night? we are Gentlemen and strangers, and will pay you well for it.

Clod.
Ay bier Lady con I, the best ludging and d•••t too in awe Loncashire, Yonder at the •ough where yeow seen the leeghts there.

D•ubt.
Whose house is that?

Clod.
Why what a pox, w•ere •an yeow lived? why yeow are Strongers indeed! why, it is Sir Yedard Harfourts, he 〈…〉 to all Gentry, yeou• st be welcome to him by day and by neeg•t 〈◊〉 Lord of awe here abouts.

Bell.
My Mistresses Father, Lu•k if it be thy will, have at my Isabella, Can thou guide us thither?

Clod.
Ay, Ay, there's a power of Company there naw, S•• Ieffery Shaklehead, and the Knight his Son, and Daughter.

Doubt.
Lucky above my wishes, o my Dear Theodosia, how my heart leaps at her! 〈…〉 guide us thither, we'll pay thee well.

Clod.
Come on, I am e•n breed aut o my senses, I was ne'er so freeghtend sin I was born, give me your honed.

Bell.
No here are our men and Horses, we'll get up, and you shall lead the fore∣most: Now Stars be kind.

Ex. Omnes,




ACT. II.
Enter Isabella and Smirk.
Isab.
HOW this insolence provokes me!
aside.
You are not sure in earnest!
to him.
Smirk.
Can any one behold those radiant eyes
And not have sentiments of Love like mine?
Isab.
This fellow has read Romances as well as Scholmen▪
Smirk.
Those eyes to which mine are the Burning-glasses
That to my heart convey the fire of Love.
Isab.
What a •ustian Fool's this! Is this language
For a Divine?
Smirk.
Are not Divines made of those Elements
Which make up other men: Divines may be
In love I hope.
Isab.
And may they make love to the Daughter withou•
The consent of the Father?
Smirk.
Undoubtedly, as Casuists must determine.
Isab.
Will not common sense, without a Casuist, tell
Us when we do wrong, if so, the Law we are
Bound to is not plan enough.
Smirk.
Submit to the judgment of Divines (sweet Lady)
Marriage is not an Ordinance made by Parents,
B•t from above derived▪ and it is for that I sue.
Isab.
Is it not fit I should obey my Father?
Smirk.
O no, sweet Lady, ••ve it not to him,
Your Father has not reverence enough
For the Church and Churchmen,
Besides, I'll tell you,
He is Atheistically inclined: pardon my boldness▪
For he believes no Witches: But, Madam, if my
Poor person and my parts may seem gracious to you,
You lawfully may choose me to make happy.
Isab.
Your person needs must please; •It is amiable.
Smirk.
Ah sweet Madam!
Isab.
Your parts beyond exception, •eat, spruce, florid,
And very ••verting.
Smirk.
No, no, dear Madam.
Isab.
Who can behold your face without pleasure? or
Consider your parts without Reverence?



Smirk.
O Lord, I swear you pose me with your great civilities: I profess you do.

Isab.
It is impossible you should keep long from being Dignified.

Smirk.
It is that I m•inly aim at next the enjoyment
Of so fine a Lady.
Isab.
May I •latter my self to think you are in earnest?
Smirk.
You may most excellent Lady.
Isab.
And so am I.
She gives him a box on the Ear.
Smirk.
Sweet Madam, I receive you as a blessing on my knees.
Isab.
Thou most insolent of Pedants, thou silly formal Thing with a stiff plain band, a lit∣tle parsonical Grogram and a Girdle thou art so proud of, in which thou would do well to hang thy self; some have vouchsafed to use it to that purpose: Thou that never were but a Curate,—a Iourney-man Divine, as thy Father was a Iourney-man Taylor, before he could set up for himself, to have the impudence to pretend love to me!

Smirk.
My function yet, I say, deserves more reverence.

Isab.
Does it make you not an Ass, or not a Taylors Son?

Smirk.
It equals me with the best of Gentry.

Isab.
How Arrogance! Can any power give honour but the Kings? This is Popery, I•e have you trounced. Could it once enter into thy vain pate, that I could be contented with the pitiful equipage of a Parsons Wife? Bless me• to be carried home to an antique building, with narrow windows, and huge Iron-bars, like an old Jail in some Country Borough, wickedly abused too with delapidations. To lye in Darneux Curtains, and a Beds-Tester, carved with Idolatrous Images, out of two load of old Timber: or to have for a Friend or a Lying in, one better, one of worsted Chamblet, and to be dressed and undressed by my Cookmaid, who is my Woman and my Chambermaid, and serves me and the Hogs.

Smirk.
I intend none of these. I assure you my House shall be—

Isab.
I know what it will be: your Parlour hung with Green printed stuff, of the new fa∣shion, with guilt Leather in panes, a fingers breadth at least, sruft up with a great many stinking Russia Leather Chairs, and an odious Carpet of the same: Then Shelves on one side of your Chimney for a pair of Tables, A Chess-board, your frame of Wax Candle and To∣bacco-pipes.

Smirk.
No, no, no, Madam.

Isab.
On the other side, Shelves for huge Folices, by which you would be counted a great read man; vast large volumes of expositions upon a short Creed; some Twenty folio's upon the Ten Commandments; Lauds, Heylins, Andrews, and Tom Fullers works, with perhaps a piece of Austin, to show you understand a little Latin; and this is your Ecclesiastical furni∣ture, very fit for a Gentlewoman's eating room is it not?

Smirk.
I understand the mode, Madam, and contemn such vulgar Ornaments.

Isab.
And in this Parlour to eat Five Tithe-Piggs in a week, brought in by my Woman-Chambermaid, Wash-maid, Cook-maid, &c. And if it be not a working day, waited on by your Groom, Ploughman, Carter, Butler, Tithe-gatherer all in one, with Horse-naild Shoes; his head new kemb•d and slick'd, with a starc'd-Band and no Cuffs.

Smirk.
My merits will provide you better, please to bear me.


Isab.
Yes, I know your merits. Then to quible with you, for my desert, your Back-side of half an Acre, with some Sixteen Trees of Marigold and Sweeting-Apples, Horse-Plums, and Warden-pares, hem•d in with panes of antique crumbling Clay; where I should have six Hives of Bees, and you a Mare and Feal, going with a Peacock and Hen.

Smirk.
All these I much despise would you hey•.

Isab.
Hear, yes, how I should have nothing to entertain my Visitors with, but stewed Prunes and H•nycombs, and flying Ale bottled with Lymen-pill, without all sight of Wine. And should I march abroad to visit, •would be behind my Can•nical Husband, perhaps upon a pied ••lt Mare big with Foal, holding both hands upon his Girdle, and when at place appointed I arrive, for want of Groom, off slips my nimble Husband first, then helps me down. And now, Foe•l, I have painted thee, and what thou art to trust to, in thy colours.

Smirk.
I beseech you, Madam, moderate your passions: Hear my propositions.

Isab.
No, Impudence, my Father shall hear 'em.

Smirk.
I beseech you, Madam, for Heavens sake, that will undo me. I shall desist, I shall desist.

Ex. Isabella.
Enter Susan the Chambermaid.
Good lack how a man may be mistaken!
I durst ha sworn, by her courtesy and frequent smiles, she had been in love with me.
Susan.
Sweet Sir, what is befallen you? has my Lady angered you? If she can, her heart is not like mine.

Smirk.
Nothing, Mrs. Susan, nothing, but to be thus despised.

To himself.
Susan.
Dear Sir, can I serve you in any thing? I am bound. I ne'er have been so elevated by any man; methinks I never should have enough of your powerful Mi∣•istry sweet Sir.

Smirk.
Pish: If she tells her Father I am ruined.

To himself.
Susan.
Dear man, now, come drive away this sadness.
Come, give me thy hand; let's sit down and be merry.
Smirk.
How! my hand! go too.
This creature is in Love with me: But shall my prodigious natural parts, and no less amazing acquisitions in Metaphysics and Schooled Divinity be cast upon a Chamber∣maid? Farewell, I must not be too familiar.

Exit.
Susan.
So scornful! Cruel creature, I will soften thee yet. Have I for thee set days and nights cross-legged and sighed before thou came hither? And fasted on St. Agnes night for thee? And since thy coming have tied three coloured True Loves Knots, quelled thy Cuffs and startch•d thy Band my self, and never failed thee of thy morning Ca•dl or Jelly Broth? have I already put my Hair and Nails in Powder in thy Drink, and put a live Fish in a part about me till it died, and then gave it thee to eat in thy Drink, and all for this? Well, I will mollify thee. And Mother Demdike shall help me to morrow: I•le to her, and discourse her about it. If I have breath, I cannot live without him.




Enter Sir Edward Harfort and his Son.
Sir Adieu.
Susan, Go tell my Cousin Theodosia, I would speak with her.

Susan.
I will Sir.

Exit.
Yo. Har.
Pshaw, now must I be troubled with making Love; a deuce take it for me: I had rather be a Coursing an it were time o•th day.

Sir Adieu.
Now Son, for your own good and my satisfaction, I would have you (since her Father and I am agreed) to settle this business, and marry with Theodosia with all the speed that can be.

Yo. Har.
What haste Sir? For my part I care not for Marriage, not I. I love my Neighbours, a Cup of Ale, and my sports, I care for nought else.

Sir Adieu.
(But that thy Mother was too virtuous for my suspicion) I should think that by thy •ordid mind thou were a Stranger to my Blood; and, if you be not ruled by me, assure your self I'll make you a stranger to my Estate.

Yo. Har.
What does he mean now? hah, to disinherit me?

Sir Adieu.
No, part of its entail•d; and if you will not marry where I direct you, your Sister will obey me, and may bring me one to inherit it. Consider that.

Enter Theodosia.
Here comes your Mistress, beautiful and good as any of her Sex. Sweet Cousin be pleased to stay one moment with my Son: I•le wait on you again.

Exit.
Theo.
Your Servant Sir. How shall I be entertained by this Dolt! How much ra∣there had he be with Country Justices and Farmers, in a low Thatched House, with a smooth Black Pot of Ale in his hand, or with his Kites, Dogs and Cattle?

Yo. Har.
What a Devil shall I say to her now? I had as leive knock my head against the wall as make Love. Will you please to sit down Cousin?

Theo.
Ay Cousin. And fall fast asleep if I can.

Aside.
Yo. Har.
It was a great Storm, and rose very suddenly to night Cousin.

Theo.
Very true.

Yo. Har.
Pox, I don't know what to say to her.
Aside.
It is almost over though now.
To her.
Theo.
'•is so.

Yo. Har.
It is so, What a Devil shall I say more? Would I were at six go downs •upon reputation, in Ale, with honest Tom Shaklehead.

Aside.
What do you think it is a Clock Madam?
To her.
Theo.
Six minutes past eight by mine.

Yo. Har.
Mine goes faster, Is yours Aspenwolds?

Theo.
No Tompions.

Yo. Har.
It is a very pretty one! Pish, I can go no farther, not I.

Theo.
It is Bed-time.

Yo. Har.
Ay so it is, and I am main sleepy bier Lady,
Coursing had gotten me a woundy Stomach,
And I eat like a Swine Faith and Troth.


Theo.
But it got you nothing to your Stomach.

Yo. Har.
You have heard the story, we coursed a Witch all day instead of a Hair; Mother Demdike.

Theo.
It is well you did not catch her, she would have been very tough meat.

Yo. Har.
Ha, ha, ha, well I •ow that•s very well. I hope Sir Ieffery will hang the Wit•h; I am sure she has tired my Dogs and me so, that I am so sleepy I can scarce hold up my head by•r Lady.

Theo.
I am tired too: This dullness is almost as tedious as his making of Love would be.

Yo. Har.
If it would hold up now, we should have fine weather for Hawking to morrow, and then have at the Pouts.

Theo.
Your Hawks would not fly at Mother Demdike too.

Yo. Har.
Nay, marry I cannot tell: But would you would go a Hawking, you should ride upon a Pad of mine, should carry you with a Bumper in your hand, and not spill a drop.

Theo.
I am for no Field sports I thank you Sir.

Yo. Har.
Now can't I speak a word more.

They paws.
Theo.
Now methinks we are mere man and Wife already, without marrying for the matter. Hah, he's asleep, and snores like the Base-pipe of an Organ: Though I like his indifference better than I should his Love; yet I have no patience to bear sleeping in my face; that's a little too much.

Yo. Har.
Oh Lord, what's that! Oh Mother Demdike! Oh, oh, the Witch, the Witch!

Theo.
He talks in his sleep, I believe, even as well, as when he's awake.

Yo. Har.
Murder, murder, oh help, the Witch; oh the Witch, oh, oh, Mother Demdike!

Theo.
He talks and dreams of the Witch: I'll try a trick with him.

She pulls the chair from under him. Et exit.
Yo. Har.
Oh help, help, the Witch, the Witch, ay there she vanished: I saw her, oh she flew up the Chimney. I'll go to Sir Ieffery, and take my Oath presently. Oh I am fore frightened.

Enter Isabella.
Oh the Witch, the Witch, Mother Demdike.
Exit yo▪ Har.
Isab.
What ails the Fool, is he mad?
Here's a Coil with Witches.
Enter Sir Jeffery, Lady Shacklehead and Sir Timothy.
Sir Tim.
Oh Madam, are you there? I have done your errant.

L. Sha.
Your Servant Cousin.

Isab.
Your Ladyships humble Servant.

L. Sha.
Look you Cousin, Lady me no Ladies, unless you be civiller to Sir Timo∣thy.



Sir Tim.
Look you there.

Sir Ieff.
I suppose you are not ignorant who we are.

La. Sha.
Nay, prithee, Sir Ieffery, hold; Let me alone.

Sir Ieff.
Nay, go on my Dear, thou shalt have it; well, thou art as notable a wo∣man as any is within Fifty miles of thy head, I•le say that for thee.

La. Sha.
Pray Cousin conceive me, breeding is a fine thing; but you have always lived in the Country▪ I have, for my part, been often at London, lodged in Covent-Gar∣den ay, and been in the drawing Room too. Poor creature, she does not know what that is.

Sir. Ieff.
Pray mind my Chicken, she's the best bred Woman in the Country.

L. Sha.
Pray spare me Sir Ieffery, here's Sir Timothy, I have bred him with great care and charges at Oxford and the Inns of Court.

Sir Tim.
Ay, and I have been in the Drawing-Room too.

L. Sha.
I have gotten him Knighted too, for mine and Sir Iefferies services, which we have performed in governing the Country about us so well.

Isab.
What does your Ladyship drive at?

Sir Tim.
Ay, you know well enough: Now you look as if Butter would not melt in your mouth.

La. Sha.
Besides, let me tell you, Sir Timothy's person's as charming as another; his shape and height perfect, his Face, though I say it, exceeding good, his Eyes vigour∣os and sparkling his Nose and Chin resembling our Family; in short, Nature has not been negligent in his Composition.

Sir Ieff.
Well, thou art the best spoken Woman in England, I'll say that for thee.

Isab.
I confess all this Madam.

Sir Tim.
Oh, do you so.

La. Sha.
Pray give me leave, not one Knight in the Land dresses better, or wears better fancied Garniture, or better P•riwigs.

Sir Tim.
My Triming's my own fancy; and the best Wigg-maker in England, one in Crooked-lane works for me.

La. Sha.
Hold Sir Timothy, I say these things premis'd, it is not •it to use my Son uncivilly: I am loath to complain to your Father, consider and be wise. I know we are politically coy, that's decent; I, my self, was so to Sir Ieffery.

Sir Ieff.
Ay by'r Lady was she. Well, I thought I should never have won thee▪ Thou were a parlous Girl.

La. Sha.
But I was never uncivil.

Isab.
I know not what you mean! I uncivil to my dear Cousin! what make•s thee think so? I assure your Ladyship I value him as he deserves. What Cousin art angry for a jest? I think no man like him for my part.

Sir Ieff.
Why, look you Sir Timothy.

La. Sha.
Nay Sir Timothy, you are to blame, jesting shows ones kindness, go too.

Sir Tim.
I swear and vow I thought you had been in earnest Cousin. I am your humble Servant.

La. Sha.
Well, we'll leave you together.

Sir Ieff.
Come on Boy, stand up to her, Gad I bore up briskly to thy Mother be∣fore I won her. Ah, when I was young, I would have—Well, no more to be ••id.



La. Sha.
Come, come away, you will have your saying!

Exit. Lady and Sir Ieff•rye.
Sir Tim.
Well, but have you so good an opinion of me as you declare•d? hum—

Isab.
The very same I assure you.

Sir Tim.
Ah my dear pretty Rogue! Then I•le marry you presently, and make you a La•y.

Isab.
Let me see, are they out of hearing?

Sir Tim.
Come f•th, let's kiss upon that business, here's a Parson in the House; nay, feth, feth, I must kiss thee, my dear little Rogue.

Isab.
Stand off Baboon, nay, a Baboon of good parts Exceeds thee; Thou Mag∣g•t, Insect, worse then any nasty thing the Sun is Father to.

Sir Tim.
What do you begin to call names again? but this is in Jest too prithee, •et me Kiss thee, pray dear, feth do.

Isab.
In •est! Heaven is my witness theres not a living thing •upon Two Legs I would not choose before Thee.

Sir Tim.
Hello, Wheres Sir Ieffery and my Lady?

Isab.
They are out of thy hearing Oaph. 'Slife how dare thou be so Impudent to love me with that face, that can provoke nothing but laughter at best in any one? Why thou ha•t the Rickets in thy fa••: There•s no proportion, every feature by it s•lf is abominable; and put togeth•r I•tolerable. Thou hast the very Lines and air of a Pigs face, Baptist Port would have drawn thee so.

Sir Tim.
Hah, What do you say? my face! I'll not change with ever a man in Lancashire. Face! talk of my face, Hah.

Isab.
Thou art uglier than any Witch in Lancashire, and if thou were in Women's Clothes, thy own Father would apprehend thee for one: Thy Face, I never saw so deformed a thing on the head of an old Lyra viol. It might fright Birds from a Cherry garden: But what else it is good for, I know not.

Sir Tim.
'Sbud, now you provoke me, I must tell you, I think my self as handsome for a Man, as you are for a woman.

Isab.
Oh, foh, out upon that filthy visage, My maid with her Sizars in two mi∣nuts shall Cut me a Better in brown paper. There is not a Creature upon Earth but i• a Beauty to thee; besides, thou hast a hollw Tooth would Cure the Mother beyond •r•a setida or burnt Feathers.

Enter Theodosia.
Sir Tim.
Well, well, You'll sing another note when I have acquainted your Father, you will.

Isab.
Thou li••t, I will not▪ If I were condemned to Death, I would not take a pardon 〈◊〉 marry thee. Set thy Fools heart at rest then, and make no more nauseous Love to m•. Thy Face to one fasting would give a vomit beyond Crocus.

Sir Tim.
You are a proud, peevish, Mi•x, and that's the best of you. Let me tell you that, hum. I can have your betters every day I rise.

Theo.
How now! What says the fool?

Sir Tim.
Uds Ludlikins, huswife, If you provoke me I'll take you of the Pate.

Isab.
Thou odious, Loathsome Coxcomb, out of my sight, or I'll tear thy Eyes ou•.




Sir. Tim.
Coxcomb! ha, ha, ha, ah thou are a good one. Well I say no more.

Isab.
Da, da, pretty thing!

Enter Sir Edward, Bellfort and Doubty.
Sir Adieu.
Gentlemen, the storm has obliged me that drove you under my Roof, I knew your Fathers well, we were in Italy together, and all of us came home with our English Religion, and our English Principles. During your stay here (which for my own sake I hope will not be short) command my House: let not your Dogs and Servants lye at Wholly; but be pleased to know this House is yours, and you will do me honour in commanding it.

Bell.
This generosity makes good the Character that all men give of you.

Doubt.
A Character that England rings with, and all men of never so differing open∣nions agree in.

Sir Adieu.
Gentlemen, you do me too much honour; I would endeavour to imi∣tate the life of our English Gentry before we were corrupted with the base man∣ners of the Fren•h.

Bell.
If all had had that Noble resolution, long since we had curbed the greatness of that Monarch.

Isab.
What are these Apparitions, Doubty and Bellfort!

Theo.
They are they indeed. Hay, what ails my heart to beat so fast?

Isab.
Methinks mine is a little too busy here.

Sir Adieu.
Gentlemen, here is my Daughter and her Kinswoman, I think you saw 'em last Summer at Scarbrough.

Bell.
We did Sir.

They salute 'em.
Doubt.
We little thought to have the honour of seeing so fine Ladies this night.

Enter Servant, and whispers to Sir Edward.
Bell.
We could not expect this happiness, till next Season at the Waters.

Sir Adieu.
What story is this? My Son almost frighted out of his wits with a Witch! Gentlemen, I beg your pardon for a moment.

Ex. Sir Edward and Servant.
Both.
Your humble Servant.

Isab.
Nothing could be more unexpected than seeing you here!

Theo.
Pray Gentlemen, How did you come?

Doubt.
Travelling for Wholly, where I told you, Madam, in my Letters, I would suddenly be, we lost our way by the darkness of the night, and wander•d till we came near this House, whither an honest Co•ntry fellow brought us for shelter from this dreadful Tempest.

Bell.
And your Father is pleased to admit a brace of stray-fellows with the greatest civility in the world: But, Madam, coming safe to shore, after a Shipwreck, could not bring such joy to me, as I find in seeing you.

To Isab.
Doubt.
The Sun, to a man left a Winter at Greenland, could not be so ravishing a sight, as you dear Madam are to me.

To Theo.
Theo.
This is Knight Errantry indeed.

Isab.
Methinks they talk Romance too. But it is too late if they be in earnest; for the Dames are disposed of.



Bell. Doubt.
How, Married!

Isab.
Not executed but condemned!

Theo.
Beyond all hopes of mercy.

Doubt.
Death, Madam, you struck me to the heart: I felt your Words here.

Bell.
My heart was just at my mouth, if you had not stopped it with this Cordial 'thad slown. I may live now in hope of a reprieve for you.

Isab.
Our Fathers will never consent to that.

Theo.
Mine will not I am sure. I have a Mother, to boot, more obstinate than he.

Doubt.
If they be so merciless, self-preservation, the great Law of Nature will ju∣stify your escape.

Bell.
We Knight Errants, as you call us▪ will rescue you I• warrant you.

Isab.
But if we leave our fools, our Fathers will leave us.

B•ll.
If you lose your Father, Madam, you shall find one that will value you in•initely more, and love you more tenderly.

Doubt.
And you, Madam, shall meet with one, whose person and whose fortune shall be always at your command.

Theo.
We grow a little too serious about this matter.

Isab.
It is from Matrimony we would fly! oh it is a dreadful thing.

Bell.
This heresy can never be defended by you: a man must be blind that inclines to that opinion before you.

Enter Sir Edward, Smirk, Servants.
Sir Adieu.
Gentlemen, I ask your pardon, be pleased to walk into the next Room, and take a small Collation to refresh your selves.

Bell.
Your Humble Servant.

Sir Adieu.
This Country Fellow that led you hither, tells me a Tale of Witches, and here's and uproar in my Family, and they say this place is haunted with them; I hope you have no faith in those things.

Doubt.
When I hear a very strange story, I always think it is more likely he should lye that tells it me, than that should be true.

Sir Adieu.
It is a good rule for our belief.

Exeunt.
Smirk.
My blood rises at them, These are damned Hobbists and Atheists, I'd have 'em burn• in Smithfield.

Isab.
Well, these Gentlemen may perhaps go to their Servants and Horses at Whal∣l•y to morrow, where they must stay some time before we see 'em again.

Theod.
We are ruined then: For this Marriage will be so pressed upon us, now the Writings are sealed, and Clothes bought, we shall have no way to delay it, but down∣right breaking with our Fathers.

Isab.
I am resolve•d to consult with the Gentlemen this night whatever comes on it.

Theo.
How can thou possibly bring it about my Dear?

Isab.
I warrant thee, a Women's wit will naturally work about these matters. Come my Dear.

To a Mothers Bed I softly crept,
And while the unchristen'd Brat yet slept,

And stole another flesh and fat,
Which I will boil before it stink;
The thick for Ointment, then for Drink
I•le keep—

I bit dried Sinews and shrunk Veins.
Marrow and Entrails I have Brought,

And of the Rope the fatal Knot.
I sunk a Ship, and in my flight
I kicked a Steeple down to Night.

And the blood of murdered men,
[q] A mad Dogs Foam, and a Wolves Hairs,
A Serpents Bowels, Adders Ears,
I put in my Po•ch; and coming back
The Bells in a Steeple I did crack.
I sent the murren into Hogs,

Just as his Dam was brought to Bed,
Before she li•knight it; and I have some

When she's in Lust; and as I came home
I put a woman into •its
And •righted a Parson out of his wits.

WHat joy like ours can mortals find?
We can command the Sea and Wind:
All Elements our Charms obey,
And all good things become our prey;
The daintiest Meat, and lustiest Wine,
We for our Sabaths still design.
Amongst all the great Princes the sun shall ere see.
None can be so great, or so happy as we.

We Sail in Egg-shells on rough Seas,
And se• strange 〈◊〉 when we please▪
Or on our Be•soms we can fly,
And nimbly mounting to the Sky,
We leave the swiftest Birds behind,
And when we please outstrip the Wind:
Then we feast and we revel after long •light,
Or with a Loved Incubus sport all the night.

3.
When we're on Wing, we sport and play,
Mankind, like Emmets, we survey;
With Lightening blast with Thunder Kill.
Cause barrenness where ever we will.
Of full revenge we have the power;
And Heaven it self can have no more.
Here is a health to our Master the Prince of the Flies,
Who commands from Center all up to the Skies.

ACT. III.
Enter Sir Edward Harfort, Bellfort and Doubty.
Doubt.
YOu have extremely delighted us this morning, by your House, Gardens, your Accommodation, and your way of Living, you put me in mind of the renowned Sidneys Admirable description of Calendar.

Sir Adieu.
Sir you Complement me too much.

Bell.
Methinks you represent to us the Golden days of Queen Elizabeth, such sure were our Gentry then; now they are grown Servile Apes to Foreign customs, they leave off Hospitality, for which we were famous all over Europe, and turn Servants to Board-wages.

Sir Adieu.
For my part, I love to have my Servants part of my Family, the other were to hire day Labourers to wait on me, I had rather my Friends, Kindred, Ten∣nants and Servants should live well out of me, than Coach-makers, Taylors, Em∣broiderers, and Lace-man should: To be pointed at in the Streets, and have Fools stare at my Equipage, is a vanity I have always scorned.

Doubt.
You speak like one descended from those Noble Ancestors that made France tremble, and all the rest of Europe Honour 'em.

Sir Adieu.
I reverence the Memory of 'em: But our New-fashion'd Gentry love the French too well to fight against 'em; they are bred abroad without knowing any thing of our Constitution, and come home tainted with Foppery, slavish Principles, and Popish Religion.

Bell.
They bring home Arts of Building from hot Countries to serve for our cold one; and F••gality from those places where they have little Meat and small Stomachs, to suffice us who have great plenty and lusty Appetites.

Doubt.
They build Houses with Halls in 'em, not so big as former Porches; Beg∣gorse were better entertained by their Ancestors, than their Tenants by them.

Sir Adieu.
For my part, I think it was never good days, but when great Tables were kept in large Halls; the Buttery-hatch always open, Black Jacks, and a good smell of Meat and March-beer, with Dogs-turds, and Mary-bones as Ornaments in the Hall: These were signs of good House keeping, I hate to see Italian fine Buildings with no Meat or Drink in 'em▪

Bell.
I like not their little Plates, methinks there's Virtue in an English Sur-loyn.

Doubt.
Our Sparks bring nothing but Foreign Vices and Follies home; it is redicu∣lous to be bred in one Country to learn to live in another.

Sir Adieu.
While we lived thus (to borrow a Coxcombly word) we made a better Figure in the World.

Bell.
You have a mind that suits your Fortune, and can make your own hap∣pines.

Sir Adieu.
The greatest is the Enjoyment of my Friends, and such Worthy gentlemen



•s your Selves, and when I cannot have enough of that; I have a Library, good Whore∣s•s and good Music.
Doubt.
Princes may envy such an English Gentleman.

Sir Adieu.
You are too kind, I am a true English man, I love the Princes Rights and P•ples liberties, and will defend 'em both with th• last penny in my purse, and the last drop •n my veins, and dare defy the witless Plots of Papists.

Bell.
Spoken like a Noble Patriot.

Sir Adieu.
Pardon me, you talk like English-men, and you have warmed me; I hope to see the Prince and People flourish yet; old as I am, inspire of Jesuits, I am sure our Constitution is the Noblest in the World.

Doub•.
Would there were enough such English Gentlemen.

Bell.
It were to be wished; but our Gentry are so much poisoned with Foreign V•nights, that methinks the Genius of England seems sunk into the Yeoma••y.

Sir Adieu.
We have indeed too many rotten Members▪ You speak like Gentlemen, Worthy of such Noble Fathers, as you both had; but Gentlemen I spoke of Music, I see two of my Artists, come into the Garden, they shall entertain you with a Song this Morning.

Bell.
Sir you oblige us every way.
An Italian Song.
Finely composed, and excellently performed.
Doubt.
I see Sir you are well served in every thing.

Enter Isabella and Theodosia.
Sir Adieu.
My sweet Cousin good Morrow to thee, I hope to call thee shortly by another Name, my dear Child, Heaven's bless thee▪

Isab. Kneels.
Bell.
Ladies your most humble Servant; you are early up to take the pleasure of the Morning in these Gardens.

Doubt.
It is a Paradise you are in; every object within this place is ravishing.

Theo.
This place affords variety of Pleasures; nothing here is wanting.

Bell.
Where such fine Ladies are.

Enter Servant with Tongue O Devilly an Irish-Priest.
Serve.
A Gentleman, To speak with you.

Sir Adieu.
With me! Daughter pray show those Gentlemen the Statues, Grottoes and the Water-works, I•le wait on you immediately.

Bell.
This is an opportunity beyond our hopes.

Ex. •ell. Doubt. Isab. Theo.
Sir Adieu.
Would you speak with me?

Priest.
Arrah, and please tie Oorship, I am come here to displaash to maake a 〈◊〉 unto thee, dest dou not know me Joy?

Sir Adieu.
Oh! You live at Mr. Redletters my Catholic Neighbours.

Priest.
Ah by my Should, I.

Sir Adieu.
How came you to venture hither? you are a Popish-Priest.

Priest.
Ay, but it is no matter for all daat •oy: by my Should, but I will taak de


Oats, and I think I will be excused, but hark 〈◊〉 you a while, by my trott I shall be a Pa•pissed too for all daat, indeed, yes.
Sir Adieu.
Excellent Principles.

Priest.
I do come for de nonest to see dee, and yet I do not come on purpose gre: But it is no matter, I will talk vet you about daat, I do come upon occaasion and Mr. Redletter did shined me unto de•.

Sir Adieu.
For What?

Priest.
What will I say unto dee now, but Mr. Redletter did shined me, and yet I did come of my self too for all daat upon occaasion, daat I did hear, concerning of dee, dat die House and de Plaash is all over-run with Witches and Spirits, do you see now?

Sir Adieu.
I had best let this Fool stay to laugh at him, he may be out of the damned Plot, if any Priest was? Sure they would never trust this Fool.

Aside.
Priest.
What shoal you shay unto me upon all dis, I will exorcise doze Vetches, and I will plague dose Devils now by my Should, vet Holy-Water, and vet Relics, and I will •root 'em out of his Plaash, God sheave the King.

Sir Adieu.
I have forgot your Name.

Priest.
They do put the Name of Kelly upon me, Joy, but by my feet I am called by my own right Name, Tongue O Devilly.

Sir Adieu.
Tongue O Devilly?

Priest.
Yes, a very oold Name in Eereland by my Shalvaation, well gre, I have brought upon my Cloke-bagg shome Holy-water, and I will put it upon the Devils and de Vetches Faashes, and I will make you shome more Holy-water, and you will vaash all de Rooms vet it and bee—

Sir Adieu.
Well, Father Tongue O Devilly, You're welcome; but how •are you venture publicly in these times?

Priest.
Why, I have great consideraation upon die Prudence; for if dou woudst be∣tray me, now phare will be de soleedity of dat Joy.

Sir Adieu.
I speak not for my self, but others.

Priest.
The Devil •aak me now, I do think, I will suffer for my Religion, I am afraid I will be slain at lashed at the plaash they call Saint Ty-burn, but I do not caare by my Shalvaation; for if I will be hanged, I will be a Saint presently, and all my Country shall pray unto Saint Tongue, besides, shome great people will be naamless too, I tell you I shay no more, but I will be prayed unto Joy.

Sir Adieu.
Prayed too! Very well.

Priest.
Yes by my Shoule will I, and I will have Relics maade of me too.

Enter Servant.
Serve.
Sir Ieffery Shacklehead and my Lady have some business with you, and desire your company within.

Sir Adieu.
Come Father Tongue, come along with me, do you hear, find the Gentle∣men that are walking with my Daughter and her Cousin, and tell 'em I will wait on 'em presently.

Ex. Sir Adieu. and Priest.
Serve.
I will. They are here, Gentlemen, my Master is called away upon business



〈◊〉 begs your excuse, and will wait on you presently.
Ex. Serve.
Bell.
Heaven gives us yet a longer Opportunity, and certainly intends we should make use of it; I have my own Parson that comes to hunt with me at Wholly, Madam, an excellent School Divine, that will end all differences betwixt us.

Isab.
He is like to begin 'em betwixt us▪ the Name of a Parson is a dreadful Name upon these occasions, he I bring us into a Condition we can never get out of but by Death.

B•ll.
If the absolute command of me and my Fortune can please you, you shall never desire to get out of it.

Doubt.
I should at more distance and with more reverence approach you, Madam, did not the shortness of the time, and the great danger of losing you, force me to be free; Throw not away this precious time, a Minute now is Inestimable.

Theo.
Yet I must consider on that Minute on which the happiness or Misery of all my Life may depend.

Isab.
How can • imagine that you who have rambled up and down the Southern World, should at last •ix on a Horne-bred Mistress in the North? how can you be in earnest?

Bell.
Consult your Understanding and your Looking-Glass, one will tell you how Witty, Wise, and Good you are, the other, how Beautiful, how Sweet, how Charm∣ing.

Isab.
Men before they are Married turn the great end of their Perspective; but the little end after it.

Bell.
They are Men of ill Eyes, and worse Understanding; but for your Perfections there needs no Perspective.

Theo.
If I were inclined to Marriage, methinks we are not well enough acquainted yet to think of that.

Doubt.
To my Reputation I suppose you are no Stranger, nor to my Estate, which li•s all in the next County; and for my Love, I will convince you of it, by settling what ever you please, or all that Estate upon you before I expect any Favour from you.

Theo.
You are so Generous beyond my Deserts, that I know not how to Credit you.

Doubt.
Your Modesty is too Great, and your Faith too Little.

Enter Sir Timothy.
Sir Tim.
Death, Who are these with my Mistress and my Sister? Oh! they are the silly Fellows that we saw at the Spew, that came hither last night, do you know Sir, that this is my Mistress Sir?

Bell.
I know Sir that no man is worthy of that Honour.

Sir Tim.
Ye• Sir, I will make you know that I am Sir, and She has the Honour to be my Mi•tress.

Bell.
Very well Sir.

Sir Tim.
Very well Sir, No it is very ill Sir, that you should have the boldness to take my Mistress by the Hand Sir, and if you do Sir, I must tell▪ you Sir—What do you Smile Sir?




Bell.
A man may do what he will with his own Face. I may Smile Sir—

Sir Tim.
If you do Sir, I will fight Sir, I tell you that Sir. hah,

Isab.
Sir Timothy, you are a Bloody-minded man.

Sir Tim.
It is for my Honour, my Honour, he is plaguely afraid; look you Sir, if you Smile Sir, at me Sir, I will Kick Sir, that's more Sir.

Bell.
If you do, you will be the fifteenth man I have run through the Body Sir.

Sir Tim.
Hah! What does he say, through the Body, oh.

Theo.
Yonders my Brother, we must not be so particular, lets join.

Sir Tim.
How, the Body Sir?

Bell.
Yes Sir, and my custom is (if it be a great affront, I kill them, for) I rip out their Hearts, dry 'em to Powder, and make Snuff on 'em.

Sir Tim.
Oh Lord! Snuff!

Bell.
I have a box full in my pocket Sir, will you please to take some.

Sir Tim.
No Sir, I thank you Sir: Snuff quoth a, I will have nothing to do with such a cruel man, I say no more Sir.

Doubt.
Your Servant Sir—

Sir Tim.
Your Servant Sir: does he take such Snuff too?

Bell.
The same—do you hear Sir, if you value your own life, which I will save for the Families sakes, not a word of this to any man.

Sir Tim.
No Sir, Not I Sir? Your humble servant.

Enter Sir Edward.
Sir Adieu.
I ask your pardon Gentlemen, I was stayed by what, if you please to walk in, will divert you well enough.

Doubt.
Wee will wait on you Sir.

Sir Adieu.
Daughter, Sir Ieffery and my Ladies have made complaints of you for a∣busing Sir Timothy; let me hear no more on it, we have resolved the Marriage shall be to Morrow, it will become you to be upon a little better Terms to day.

Sir Tim.
Do you here that Gentlewoman—

Sir Adieu.
Gentlemen, I have sent to Wholly for all your Servants, and Horses, and Dogs, you Must do me the honour to Make some stay with me.

Bell.
We cannot enough acknowledge your great Civility.

Sir Adieu.
No Complements, I obliege my self; Sir Ieffery Shacklehead and I have just now agreed, that to morrow shall be the Day of Marriage between our Sons and Daughters.

Theo.
Very short warning.

Sir Adieu.
He I not delay it longer.

Theo.
I'll in and see what the reason of this sudden resolution.

Bell.
Sir we wait on you.

Sir Adieu.
Stay you there a while with Sir Timothy.

Ex. all but Sir Tim. and Isab.
Sir Tim.
Dear Cousin, prithee be kinder to me, I protest and vow, as I am a Christian, I love the better then both my Eyes, for all this.

Isab.
Why how now Dogs face, hast thou the Impudence to make love again,



with that hideous Countenance? that very insipid silly Physiognomy of thine? with that most piteous mean? why thou look like an Operate•r for Teeth.
Sir Tim.
This is all sham, I wont believe it; I can see my self in the great glass, and to my mind no man looks more like a Gentleman than my self.

Isab.
A Gentleman! with that silly waddling shuffling gate? thou hast not mien good enough for a chief Constable, every change of thy Countenance, and every motion of thy Body proclaims thee an Ass.

Sir Tim.
Ay, Ay, come Madam, I shall please you better when I am Married, with a 〈◊〉 that I have; I tell ye.

Isab.
Out of my sight, thou make me sick to see thee.

Sir Tim.
I shall be more Familiar with you to Morrow-night, oh my dear rogue—well I say no more, faith I shall, well, no more to be said.

Isab.
Be gone thou Basilic, here, I vow if thou were the only man on Earth, the Kind should cease rather than I would Marry thee.

Sir Tim.
You'll be in a better humour to Morrow-night, though you are such a 〈◊〉 now.

Isab.
This place, where some Materials are to mend the Wall, will furnish me with some Ammunition: be gone I say.

Sir Tim.
I shant do•t, I know when I am in good Company, come prithee Cousin, do not let us Fool any longer, to Morrow we shall be one flesh—de ye see:

Isab.
I had rather be inoculated into a Tree, than be made one Flesh with thee; can that Westph•lia hide of thine ever become one Flesh with me? when, I can become one Ass with thee it may, you shall never change my mind.

Sir Tim.
Well, well, I shall have your Body to Morrow-night, and I warrant you your mind shall soon follow it.

Isab.
Be gone, thou infinite Coxcomb, Isle set thee farther.

She throws Stones at him.
Sir Tim.
What, what, what a pox! hold, what a Devil, are you mad? Flesh, heart, hold, what a plague, uds bud, I could find in my heart to turn again.

Isab.
Do •ilthy Face, do if thou dare.

Sir Tim.
Oh help, murder, murder.

Ex. Sir Timothy.
Isab.
I have no patience with this Fool, no Racks, or Tortures shall force me to marry him.

Ex. Isab.
Enter Young Harford and Theodosia.
Theo.
I am very indifferent about this Matrimony, and for ought I see, you are so too.

Yo. Har.
I must confess you are as fine a Gentlewoman as ever I saw, and I am not worthy of you; but my Father says he will disinherit me, if I will not marry you to Morrow; therefore I desire you would please to think on it.

Theo.
I will think on it.

Yo Har.
You shall command all my Estate, and do what you will; for my part, I r•solve all my Life, to give up my self wholly to my Sports, and my Horses, and



my Dogs, and to drink now and then a cup of Ale with my Neighbours, I hate Wine.
Theo.
You will do very well.

Yo. Har.
He says we must be Married to Morrow at Ten, I can be going a Hawking by six and come home time enough, I would be loath to neglect my Hawking at Pow•s in the height of the Season.

Theo.
By no means, you'd do very ill if you should.

Yo. Har.
Ay so I should, but shall I tell my Father that you will have me to More∣row? you know the Writings are Sealed, and Wedding-Cloaths bought of all sides.

Theo.
Well, I shall do as becomes me.

Yo. Har.
Well, Cousin there's no more to be said betwixt you and I then, Pa•ce Verb, a word to the Wise, I say, is enough, so I rest your humble Servant to com∣mand; •e tell my Father what you say presently, your Servant to, tell you truly I had never so much mind to be Married as now; for I have been so woundedly frightened with Witches, that I am afraid to lye alone, dee see; well, I am glad this business is over: a pox upon all m•king of Love for me.

Ex. Yo. Har.
Theo.
I thought I saw my Cousin in yo• Walk, it is time for us to consult what to do, my Father and Mother are resolved upon to Morrow for the fatal day.

Ex. Theo.
Enter Smirk, and Priest, and Mrs. Susan.
Priest.
By my shoule, Joy, I thank you for my Fast-break, for it does give refreshment unto me, and Consolaation too gre.

Smirk.
Thank you Mistress Susan, my Caudle was admirable; I am much strengthened by these good Creatures.

Suss.
Yours was admirable—if Mother Demdike has any Skill, I shall find the opperati•• before night, and I will be revenged for his scorn to me.

Aside.
Priest.
Though thou dosht know me, yet thou dosht shay thou wilt tell nothing concerning of me.

Smirk.
No, for my part though I differ in some things, yet I honour the Church of Rome as a true Church.

Priest.
By my Shalvaation ye did all come out of us indeed, and I have expectaation daa• you will come in again, and I think I will live to she it; perhaps I will tell you now, you had your Ordination too with us.

Smirk.
For my part, I think the Papists are honest, loyal men, and the Iesuits dyed in∣nocent.

Priest.
Phaat dou dosht not believe de Plot de Devil taak me.

Smirk.
No, no, no Papist Plot, but a Presbyterian one.

Priest.
Aboo, boo, boo, By my Shalvaation I will embraash die Fathers Child, and I will put a great kish upon die cheek, now for dat, ay dear each a damned Presbyterian Plot to put out de Paapists, and de Priests, and de good Men, and if I would have my mind, de Devil taak me I would she 'em all broil and fry in de 〈◊〉 they call Smithfield, 〈◊〉.



Smirk.

No, but a 〈◊〉 I do.

Bell.
This is great Impudence, a•la the King has affirmed it in so many Pr•clamations, and three Parliaments have 〈◊〉 it, Nominee 〈◊〉.

Smirk.
Parliaments, tell me of Parliaments, with my Bible in my hand, •le dispute with the whole 〈◊〉 of Commons; Sir, I hate Parliaments, n•no but Phanaticks, Hobbists, and Atheists, believe the 〈◊〉.

Priest.
By my 〈…〉, dou d•sh't maak me weep indeed, by my Should, Joy, dou wilt be a good Cath•lick, if I will instruct dee, I will weep on dee indeed.

Bell.
Why the true and wise Church of England-men believes it, and are a great Rock a∣against the Church of Rome.

Doubt.
And Preach and Write learnedly against it; but such Fellows as you are scandals to the Church, a Company of Tantivy Fools.

Bell.
All the Eminent men of the Church of England believe the Plot, and detest it with horror, and abominate the Religion that contrived it.

Smirk.
Not all the Eminent men, for I am of another opinion.

Doubt.
By my should, by my Shoud, Joy, they are our Enemies, and I would have no feet put upon de••, but dis is my dear Friend.

Doubt.
This is a Rascal concealed in the Church, and is none of it; sure his Patron know• him not.

Bell.
No certainly!

Smirk.
You are Hobbists and Atheists.

Priest.
It is no ma•la for all daat Joy, what they doe shay unto dee for by Chreest, and by Saint Paatrick they be Heretic Dogs, by my Shalvaation dou dosht maake me weep upon de again; by de Lady Mary, I think I will be after reconciling deet o de Catholic Church in∣deed.

And perhaps may come to be hanged for it.

They call the Constable in and a Country fellow.
Constable.
Sir, I went to her House (and please your Worship) and looked in at her Window, and she was feeding three great Toads, and they danced and leapt about her, and she suckled a great black Cat well nigh as big as a Spaniel; I went into the House, and she vanished, and there was nothing but the Cat in the middle, who spit and stared at me, and I was frighted away.

Sir Ieff.
An arch Witch I warrant her.

Constable.
I went out at the backdoor, and by the Threshold sat a great Hare, I struck at it, and it run away, and ever since I have had a great pain in my back, and cannot make Water, saving your presence.

Why, ain't please your Worship forsooth, Mother Demdike said she would be revenge•d on me for not giving her some Butturmilk; and the next night coming from Rochdale, I saw a great Black Hog, and my Horse threw me, and I lost a Hog that night, he died, that was as well when he went to bed, as ever he was since he was born.

La. Sha.
It is enough, a plain, a manifest Witch, make a Warrant for her.

Sir Ieff.
Ay, do.

La. Sha.
Take some of the Thatch of her House, and burn it at your House, and you shall see she will come straight.

Sir Ieff.
Or to morrow about dawn, piss in a Pot, and cover it with your right, neither Stocking, and the Witch will be tormented in her Bladder, and come to you roaring before night.

These two Remedies are in Scott.
Doubt.
A most profound Science.

Bell.
And poor old Ignorant wretches must be hanged for this.

Constable.
A Cow of mine is bewitched too, and runs about the Close as if she were mad; and that, I believe, Mother Hargrave bewitched, because I denied her some 〈◊〉.—good.

Sir Ieff.
〈◊〉 into the Warrant too: It is enough, a little thing will serve for evi∣dence against • Witch.

Sir Adieu.
A very little one.

Priest.
[*] Put a pair of Breeches or Irish Trousers upon your Cows head, Fellow, upon a Friday Morning, and wid a great Stick maak beat upon her, till she do depart out of de Close, and she will repair unto de Witches door, and she will knock up∣on it vet her Horns indeed.

Constable.
Thank you good Sir.

Sir Ieff.
Sir, I see you are a Learned man in this business, and I honour you.

Priest.
Your Servant Sir, I will put shome holy waiter into your Cows mout, and I will maak Cure upon her for all daat indeed.

La. Sha.
Come, has any one else any thing to inform?

Constable.
Yes an•t please your Worship, here is a Neighbour, Thomas o Georges.

Sponsors• House where he one 〈◊〉 Lone, and whoo had a meeghty great Cat, a black one by'r Lady, and whoo kissed and who clipped Cat, and ay set me d•wn a bit (meet a bit) and believe Cat went under her Coats, Quo ay what don yeo doo with that fow Cat? why, says Whoo, who soukes me. Soukes tee! Marry that's whaint quo ay, by'r Lady what •an Cat do besides? Why, says whoo, whoost carry me to Rochdale believe. Whew, quo ay, that's pr•tty!

B••l.
Well said, this was home; I love a Fellow that will go through stitch.

Sir Ieff.
This is a Witch, indeed, put her name in.

Priest.
This is now thing by my Shoule, I will tell you now it is naw thing for all d•at, a Vi•h, if she be a good Witch, will ride upon a Graashopper, I tell you, very well,



and yet a Graashopper is but a weak beast neither; you do maak wonder upon dis• but by my Shoule it is naw thing.
Sir Ieff.
Where did you take Cat, say you, together?

Tho. o. Geor.
Why, we took Cat•ith• Lone meet a mile off.

Sir Ieff.
So you rid eight mile upon Cats: are there any more information?

Constable.
No more an•t please your Worship, but when I have once taken 'em, enough will come in.

La. Sha.
Go then about taking 'em, and bring 'em before Sir Ieffery, and my self, Ple warrant you we'll order 'em.

Priest.
I will tell you now Fellow, taak de shoe of a Horse, and nail it upon your Threshold, de plaash dou dosht go into die door upon.

Sir Ieff.
And put a Clove of Garlic into the Roof of thy Ho•se.

La. Sha.
Femel is very good in your House against Spirits and Witches, and Alicium, and the Herb Mullein, and Long-wort, and Moly too is very good.

Priest.
[*] Burn shome Brimstone, and maak a sweet fume of de Gall of a Black Dog, Joy, and be∣smear die Pots, and die Walls, and bee, and Cross die Self, and I will touch dee vet Relics, and dee to gre.

Constable.
Thank you good Sir.

Tho. o Geor.
Thank a.

Sir Adieu.
Is not this an excellent Art?

Bell.
It is so extravagant, that a man would think they were all in Dreams that ever writ of it.

Doubt.
I see no manner of Evidences against these poor Creatures.

Bell.
I could laugh at the•e Fools sufficiently, but that all the while our Mistresses are in danger.

Doubt.
Our time is very short, prithee let's consider what is to be done.

Isab.
Well, my Dear, I must open my heart to thee; I am so much in Love with this Bellfort, that I shall dye if I lose him.

Theo.
Poor Isabella, dying is something an inconvenient business; and yet I should live very uncomfortable without my Spark.

Isab.
Our time's very short, therefore prithee let's play the fool no longer, but come to the point when we meet 'em.

Theo.
Agreed: But when shall we meet 'em?

Isab.
I warrant thee before Midnight.

Sir Adieu.
Come, let us take one turn in the Garden, and by that time my Dinner will be ready.

Bell.
Madam, For Heaven's sake consider on what a short time my Happiness or Ruin depends.

Isab.
Have a care, Sir Ieffery and his Lady will be Jealous.

Bell.
This is a good sign.

To himself.
Theo.
Not a word, we shall be suspected, at night we will design a conference.

Song.
Chor. of 3 parts.
WElcome, welcome, happy be,
In this blessed Society.

1.
Men and Beasts are in thy Power,
Thou can Save, and can Devour,
Thou can Bless, and Curse the Earth,
And cause Plenty, or a Dearth.
Chor.
Welcome, &c.

2.
O'er Natures Powers thou can prevail,
Raise Winds, bring Snow, or Rain, or Hail;
Without their Causes, and can make
The steady Course of Nature shake.




Chor.
Welcome, &c.

3.
Thou can mount upon the Clouds,
And skim o'er the rugged Floods;
Thou can dive to the Sands below,
And through the solid earth can go.
Chor.
Welcome, &c.

4.
Thou'lt open Looks, or through a Chink
Shalt creep for daintiest Meat and Drink.
Thou may sleep on tops of Trees,
And lye in Flowers like Humble Bees.
Chor.
Welcome, &c.

5.
Revenge, revenge, the sweetest part
Of all thou hast by thy black Art.
O• Heaven thou ne'er shalt f•x thy mind,
For here it is Heaven to plague mankind.
They Dance with fantastic unusual postures
Devil.
[p] At your command all Natures course shall cease,
And all the Elements make war or peace:
The Sky no more shall its known Laws obey,
Night shall retreat whilst you prolong the day.
[q] Thy Charms shall make the Moon and Stars come down,
And in thick darkness, hide the Sun at Noon.
[r] Winds thou shalt raise, and straight their rage control.
[s] The Orbs upon their Axes shall not roll;
Hearing thy mighty Charms, the troubled Sky
Shall crack with Thunder, Heaven not knowing why.
[t] Without one puff the Waves shall foam and rage,
Then though all Winds together should engage,
The silent Sea shall not the Tempest feel.
[u] Valleys shall roar, and trembling Mountains reel.
[x] At thy command Woods from their seats shall rove,
Stones from their Quarries, and fixed Oaks remove.
[y] Vast standing lakes shall flow, and, at thy will,
The most impetuous Torrents shall stand still:
Swift Rivers shall (while wondering Banks admire)
Back to their Springs, with violent hast, retire.
[z] Thy Charms shall blast full Fruits, and ripened Ears.
[a] Ease anxious minds, and th•n afflict with cares.
[b] Give Love, where Nature cannot, by thy skill,
And any living creature save or kill:
[c] Raise Ghosts, transform your self and whom you will.

ACT. IV.
Sir Edward, Sir Ieffery, La. Shaklehead, Sir Timothy and Isabella.
Sir Ie••.
I Am sorry I am forced to complain of my Cousin.

La. Sha.
Sorry, marry so am not I; I am sorry she is so pert and ill-bred, truly Sir Edward it is unsufferable for my Son, a man of his Quality and Title, Born of such a Family, and so Educated, to be so abused, to have Stones thrown at him li•e a Dog.

Sir Ieff.
We must even break off the Match, Sir Edward.

Sir Adieu.
Sir, I am as••med of it, I blush and grieve to hear it; Daughter, I never thought to see this day.

〈◊〉.
Sir, I am so amazed I know not what to say, I abuse my Cousin! Sure he is b•witched.

Sir Tim.
I think I am, to Love you after it, I am sure my Arm's black and blew, that it is.

〈◊〉.
He •acted with me, as I thought, and would have ruffled me, and kissed me, a•d I run from him, and in foolish play, I quoited a little Stone or two at him.

Sir Tim.
And why did you call me Filthy-face, and ugly Fellow, h•h, Gentlewo∣man?

La. Sha
He ugly! Nay, then I have no Eyes, though I say it, that should not say it, 〈…〉 his Fellow—




Isab.
Nor I neither: it was a jest, a jest, he told me he was handsomer for a Man, than I for a Woman.

Sir Ieff.
Why, look you there, you Blockhead, you Clown, you Puppy, why do you trouble us with this impertinent lye?

La. Sha.
Good words, Sir Ieffery, it was not so much amiss; hah, I'll tell you that.

Sir Adieu.
Sure this is some mistake, you told me you were willing to marry.

Isab.
I did not think I should be put to acknowledge it before this Company: But Heaven knows, I am not more willing to live; the time is now so short, I may con∣fess it.

Sir Adieu.
You would not use him, you intend to marry, ill.

Isab.
I Love him I am to marry more than Light or Liberty. I have thus long dis∣sembled it through Modesty; but, now I am provoked, I beseech you Sir, think not that I'd dishonour you so.

Sir Adieu.
Look you, you have made her weep; I never found her false or disobe∣dient.

Sir Tim.
Nay, good dear Cousin, don't cry, you'll make me cry too; I can't forbear, I ask your pardon with all my heart, I vow I do, I was to blame, I must confess.

La. Sha.
Go too, Sir Timothy, I never could believe one of your parts would play the Fool so.

Sir Adieu.
And you will marry to morrow.

Isab.
I never wished for any thing so much, you make me blush to say this.

La. Sha.
Sweet Cousin forgive me, and Sir Ieffery, and Sir Timothy.

Isab.
Can I be angry at any thing▪ when I am to be married to morrow? And I am sure I will be, to him I love more than I hate this Fool.

[Aside]
Sir Ieff.
I could find in my heart to break your head, Sir Timothy, you are a Puppy.

Sir Adieu.
Come lets leave 'em together, to understand one another better.

Sir Ieff.
Cousin, Daughter I should say, I beg your pardon, your Servant.

La. Sha.
Servant, Sweet Daughter.

Ex. Sir Adieu. Sir Jeff. and Lady.
Sir Tim.
Dear Cousin be in good humour, I could wish my self well beaten for mistaking one that loves me so, I would I might ne'er stir, if I did not think you had been in earnest: well, but I vow and swear I am mightily beholden to you, that you think me so fine a person, and love me so dearly; Oh how happy am I that I shall have thee to morrow in these Arms! by these ten bones, I love you more than all the Ladies in London put them together. Prithee Speak to me, O that Smile Kills me, oh I will •o Hug thee and Kiss thee, and Love thee to morrow night—I'd give forty pound to morrow night were to night, I hope we shall have twins before the year comes about▪

Isab.
Do you so Puppy?

She gives him a box on the Ear, and pulls him by the Ears.
Sir Tim.
Help, Help, Murder, Murder.

Isab.
Help, Help, Murder, Murder.

Sir Tim.
What a Devils to do now? hah, she Counterfeits a Sound.


Enter Theod•sia at one Door, and Sir Ieffery, and Lady a• the other.
Theo.
How now, my Dear, what's the matter?

Sir Ieff.
What's the Matter?

Sir Tim.
I feel the matter, She gave me a Cuff, and lugged me by the Ears, and I think she is in a Sound.

I•ab.
Oh the Witch! the Witch came just now into the Room, and struck Sir Timothy, and Lugged him, and beat me down.

Sir Tim.
Oh Lord, a Witch! Ay, it was a two legged Witch.

Isab.
And, as soon as she had done, she run out of that Door.

Theo.
It is very true, I met her and was frighted, and left her muttering in the next 〈◊〉.

Sir Tim.
Oh Impudence!

Sir Ieff.
You Puppy, you Coxcomb, will you never leave these lies, is the fellow bewitched?

He cudgels Sir Tim.
La. Sha.
Go Fool, I am ashamed of you.

Sir Ieff.
Let•s see if we can take this Witch.

La. Sha.
Quickly, before she flies away.

Ex. Sir Jeff. and Lady.
Sir Tim.
Well, I have done, I'll ne'er tell tale more.

Isab.
Begone, Fool, go.

Sir Tim.
Well, I will •ndure this, but I am resolved to marry her to morrow and be revenged on her; if she serves me so then, I will tickle her Toby for her, faith I will.

Ex. Sir Tim.
Isab.
Well, I'll be gone, and get out of the way of 'em.

Theo.
Come on.

Enter Young Harfort Drunk.
Yo. Harf.
Madam! Cozen hold a little, I desire a word with you.

Theo.
I must stay.

Isab.
Adieu then.

Yo. Harf.
I am drunken well 〈◊〉, and now I am not so hala (since we must mar∣rye to morrow) I pray you n•w l•t us be a little better acquainted to neighed, He make bold to Salute you in a Civil way.

Theo.
The Fool's drunk.

Yo. Harf.
By the Mass she kisses rarely, uds lord she has a Breath as sweet as a Cow, I have been a Hawking, and have brought you home a power of Pouts in my bag here; we have had the rarest sport, we had been at it still, but that it is neighed.

Theo.
You have been at some other sport I see.

Yo. Harf.
What, because I am merry? nay, and I list, I can be as merry as the best on •em all.

An any mon Smait my Sweet hear•,
Ayst Smait him again an I con,
Flesh what care for a brokken Yead,
For onest a mon's a mon.
Theo.
I see you can be merry indeed.

Yo. Har.
Ay that I can, Fa, la, la, fa, la.

He Sings Roger a Coverly.




I was at it halter Skelter in excellent Ale, with Londoners that went a Hawking, brave Roisters, honest fellows that did not believe the Plot.
Theo.
Why don't you believe the Plot?

Yo. Har.
No, the Chaplain has told me all; there's no Popish Plot, but there's a Pres∣byterian one, he says, none but Phanaticks believe it.

Theo.
An Excellent Chaplain to make love to his Patrons Daughter, and Corrupt the Son.

Aside.
Why all the Eminent men of our Church believe it; this fellow is none of the Church, but crept into it for a livelihood, and as soon as they find him they'll turn him out of it.

Yo. Har.
Nay, Cousin I should not have told it, he Charged me to say nothing of it; but you and I a•e all one, you are to be bone of my bone to morrow: And I will Sa∣lute you once more upon that d'e see.

Theo.
Hold, Hold, not so fast it is not come to that yet.

Yo. Har.
It will come to that and more to morrow, fa, la, la, but I'll out at four a Hawking, though for all that, d'e understand me?

Theo.
Her'es Doubty, I must get rid of this fool.

Enter Doubty.
Cousin, I hear your Father coming; if he sees you in this Condition he will be very Angry.

Yo. Har.
Thank you Kindly, no more to be said, I'll go and Sleep a little, I see she loves me, fa, la, la, la.

Ex. Yo. Harfort.
Doubty.
Dear Madam, this is a happy 〈◊〉 thrown upon me unexpectedly, and I must use it: To morrow is the feral day to ruin me.

Theo.
It shall not ruin me: the Inquisition should not force me to a Marriage with this fool.

Doubty.
This is a step to my Comfort; but when your Father shall to morrow hear your refusal, you know not what his passion may produce; restraint of Liberty is the least.

Theo.
He shall not restrain my Liberty of Choice.

Doubt.
Put your self into those hands that may defend you from his Power: the hands of him, who loves you more than the most Pious value Heaven, than Misers Gold, than Clergy men love Power, than Lawyers strife, than Jesuits Blood and Treachery.

Theo.
If I could find such a man.

Doubt.
Then look no farther Madam, I am he; speak but one word, and make me the happiest man on Earth.

Theo.
It comes a little to quick upon me; are you sure you are the man you speak of?

Doubt.
By Heaven; and by your Self I am, or may I be the scorn of all Mankind; and the most Miserable too, without you.

Theo.
Then you shall be the man.

Doubt.
Heaven; on my Knees I must receive this Blessing; there's not another I would ask, my Joy's too big for me.

Theo.
No Raptures for Heavens sake, here comes my Mother, adieu.



Enter Lady Shaklehead.
Doubt.
I must Compose my self.

La. Sha.
Sir your most humble Servant.

Doubt.
Your Ladyships most humble Servant.

La. Sha.
It is not fit I should lose this opportunity, to tell you that (which per∣haps may not be unacceptable to a person of your Complexion) who is so much a Gentleman, that I'll swear I have not seen your equal.

Doubt.
Dear Madam, you confound me with your Praises.

La. Sha.
I vow it is true; indeed I have struggled with my self before I thought fit to reveal this: but the consideration of your great accomplishments, do indeed, as it were, ravish, or extort it from me, as I may so say.

Doubt.
I beseech you Madam.

La. Sha.
There is a Friend of mine, a Lady (whom the world has acknowledged to be well bread, and of Parts too, that I must say, and almost confess) not in the Bud indeed, but in the Flower of her Age, whom time has not yet invaded with his injuries; in fine, envy cannot say that she is less than a full ripe Beauty.

Doubt.
That this Creature should bring forth such a Daughter.

Aside.
La. Sha.
Fair of Complexion, Tall, Straight, and shaped much above the ordinary; in short, this Lady (whom many have Languished, and Sighed in vain for) does of her self, so much admire your Person, and your Parts, that she extremely desires to contract a Friendship with you, entire to all intents and purposes.

Doubt.
It is impossible she should be in earnest, Madam, but were she, I cannot Marry ever.

La. Sha.
Why she is Married already, Lord how dull he is! she is the best Friend I have, Married to an old man, far above her sprightly years.

Doubt.
What a Mother-in-Law am I like to have!

Aside.
La. Sha.
Can you not Guess who this is all this while?

Doubt.
Too well.
To himself.
Not I truly Madam.
To her.
La. Sha.
Ha, ha, ha, no! that's strange, ha, ha, ha.

Doubt.
I cannot possibly.

La. Sha.
Ha, ha, ha. I'll swear! ha, ha, ha.

Doubt.
No, I•le swear.

La. Sha.
It is very much, you are an ill guesser, I'll vow, ha, ha, ha! Oh Lord, not yet?

Doubt.
Not yet, nor ever can.

La. Sha.
Here's Company, retire.

Enter Smirk and Tongue O Divelly.
Smirk.
I am all on fire, what is it that Inspires me! I thought her ugly once, but this morning thought 〈…〉 in love already! Sure I was blind, she is a beauty 〈…〉 a minutes absence is death to me.



Priest.
Phaat Joy, dou art in Meditaation and Consideraation upon something? if it be a Scruple upon thy Conscience, I believe I will maak it out unto dee.

Priest.
Phaat dost dou not mind me? nor put die thought upon me?

Smirk.
It is a fine Church, a Church of Splender, and riches, and power, but there are some things in it—

Priest.
Shome things! Phaat dosht dou taalk of shome things? By my shoule I will not see a better Church in a Shommers day, indeed, dan de Caatholick Church. I tell you there is braave dignities, and promotions too; what will I shay unto you? by St. Phaatrick, but I do believe I will be a Cardinal before I will have death. They have had not one Eerish Cardinal a great while indeed.

Smirk.
What power is this that urges me so fast, oh Love! Love!

Priest.
Phaat dosht dou shay, dosht dou love promotions and dignities? den I predee now be a Caatholick. What will I say unto you more? but I will tell you, You do shay dat de Caatholicks may be shaved, and de Caatholicks do shay, dat you will be after being damned, and phare is de solidity now of daat, daat dou will not turn a good Caatholick?

Smirk.
I cannot believe there is a Purgatory.

Widout money indeed, we cannot pray them out, no feet.

Priest.
Hold him, and I will taak some course vet him, he is possessed, or obess'd, I will touch him vet some Relics.

Susan.
Oh, good Sir, help him, what shall I do for him?

La. Sha.
Get some Lead melted (and holding over his body) power it into a Po∣ringer full of Water, and if there appear any image upon the Lead, then he is be∣witched.

This experiment is to be found in Mal. Mallific.
Priest.
Peash, I shay, here is shome of St. Phaatricks own Whisker, and some of the Snuff he did use to taak, dat did hang upon his Beard; here is a Tooth of St. Winifred, indeed, here is a Corn from de Toe of St. Ignatius, and here is de paring of his Nails too.

Sir Ieff.
This Irish-man is a Gallant man about Witches, he out does me.

La. Sha.
But I do not know what to think of his Popish way, his Words, his Charms, and Holy Water, and Relics, methinks he is guilty of Witchcraft too, and you should send him to Goal for it.

Smirk.
Oh! oh!

Enter Priest with a Bottle of Holy-water.
Priest.
Now, I warrant you Joy, I will do de Devil's business for him, now I have dis Holy-Vater.

The Bottle flies out of his hand.

He runs out and fetches a Basin of Water.
Susan.
He lies as if he were a Sleep.

Smirk.
Oh! I begin to have some ease.

Priest.

He throws Water in Smirks Fact.

Smirk.
I am much better now, and the Witch is gone.

Susan.
Good Sir retire to your Chamber, I will fetch some Cordials.

Smirk.
Sweet beautiful Creature! How I am Enamoured with thee! Thy beauty dazzles like the Sun in his Meridian.

Sir Ieff.
Beauty, Enamourd! Why he seems distracted still; lead him to his Cham∣ber, and let him rest.

Priest.
Now Joy, dosht dou she, I have maade a Miracle by my shoule. Phone will I she one of your Church maake a Miracle, ho? by my Shoulevaation they cannot maake Miracles out of de Caatolick Church, I tell you now, ho.

Sir Ieff.
So do I, I am frighted and amazed; lets fly.

Ex. Sir Jeff. and La.

He mutters and Crosses himself, and the Wuch beats him out.
Enter Bellfort and Isabella.
Bell.
All this day have I watched for this opportunity, let me improve it now. Con∣cider, Madam, my Extreme Love to you, and your own harred to that Fool, for whom you are designed to morrow.

Isab.
My consent is to be had first.

Bell.
Your Fathers resentment of your refusal, may put you out of all possibility of making me happy, or providing for your own Content.

Isab.
To Marry one against his Consent is a Crime heel ne'er forgive.

Bell.
Though his Engagement to Sir Ieffery would make him Refuse his Consent beforehand: He is too reasonable a man to be troubled afterwards, at your Marrying to a better Estate, and to one that loves more than he can tell you: I have not words for it.



Isab.
Though I must Confess you may deserve much better, would you not Ima∣gin I were very forward to receive you upon so short an Acquaintance.

Bell.
Would I had a Casement in my Breast. Make me not, by your delay, the miserablest wretch on Earth. (Which I shall ever be without you) think quickly Madam, you have not time to Consider long, I lay my self at your Feet, to be for ever made happy or miserable by you.

Isab.
How shall I be sure you'll not deceive me? These hasty vows, like Angry words, Seldom shoes the Heart.

Bell.
By all the Powers of Heaven and Earth.

Isab.
Hold, Swear not, I had better take a man of honour at his Word.

Bell.
And may Heaven throw its Curses on me when I break it; my Chaplin's in the House, and passes for my valet de Chambre. Will you for ever make me Hap∣pie Madam?

Isab.
Isle trust your honour; and I'll make my self so; I throw my self upon you, use me nobly: now it is out.

Bell.
Use ye, as I would use my Soul; my Honour, my Heart, my Life, my Liberty, and all I have is yours. There's not a man in all the World, that I can envy now, or wish to be.

Isab.
Take care, we shall be spied: The short time I have to resolve in, will, I hope, make you have a better Opinion of my modesty, than otherwise you would have occasion for.

Bell.
Dearest! Sweetest of Creatures! my Joy distracts me, I cannot speak to you.

Isab.
For Heavens sake leave me, if you raise a Jealously in the House I am ruined, we'll meet soon.

Bell.
Adieu my Life! my Soul! I am all obedience.

Exit. Bellfort.
Enter Theodosia.
Isab.
Oh my Dear, I am happy, ell's out that pained me so; my Lover knows I love him.

Theo.
I have Confessed to my Ghostly Father too, and my Conscience is at ease.

Isab.
Mine received the news with more Joy, than he Could put in Words.

Enter Sir Ieffery, Lady, and Sir Timothy.
Theo.
And mine in rapture; I am the happiest Woman Living.

Isab.
I'll not yield to you at all in that.

Theo.
There's no cause, I would not submit to you in, but this my Dear.

Isab.
I will hold out in this cause while I have breath, I am happier in my Choice than all the World can make me.

Theo.
Mine is the Hansomest, Wittiest, most accomplished Gentleman—

Isab.
Mine is the beautifulest, sweetest, well-shap'd, well-bred, wittiest Gentleman—

Sir Tim.
That must be I, whom she means, for all my Quarrels with her.

La. Sha.
Peace, we shall hear more.

Theo.
Little think our Fathers how happy we shall be to morrow.

Sir Ieff.
What's that? Listen.


Isab.
(If no unlucky Accident should hinder us) we shall be far happier than they can Imagine.

Theo.
How we have Cheated them all this while!

Isab.
'Slife they are behind us, stir not. We have hidden our love from them all this while.

La. Sha.
Have you so? but we shall find it now.

aside
Isab.
Your Brother Little thinks I Love him so; For I have been Cross and coy to him on purpose. I shall be the happiest Woman in him, I am to have, that ever was.

Theo.
I could wish your Brother loved me as well as mine does you. For never Wo∣man loved the man she was to Marry as I do him, I am to have to morrow.

Sir Ieff.
That's my best Daughter, thou were ever a good Child, nay blush no•, all is out, we heard ye both.

Sir Tim.
Ay, all is out, my pretty Dear dissembler: well, I protest and vow, I am mightily obliged to you for your great love to me, and good opinion of me.

La. Sha.
I hope to morrow will be a happy day for both our families.
Enter Sir Edward, Bellfort and Doubty, and Musicians.
Oh Sir Edward, is not that strange I told you, I should not have believed it if I had not seen it.

Sir Adieu.
And pray give me the same liberty: But now we'll have some music, that's good against enchantment, Sing me the Song I Commanded you, and then we'll have a dance before we go to bed.

Song
Enter Priest.
Priest.
Ho, it is a pretty Shong, but I will shing a brave Cronan now, dat is better I tell you.

He Sings.
Sir Adieu.
It is very fine but sing me one Song more in three parts, to sweeten our Ears, for all that.[*] Why what's the matter? you gape and make faces, and do not sing, what's the matter, are you mad?

Priest.
Doe you play, play I say, Oh they are bewitched, I will shay no more.

Sir Adieu.
Play I say.

Music.
I can't, my Arms are on the sudden stiff as marble, I cannot move them.

They hold up their bows, but cannot play. Exit. Priest.

Hold, hold, prithee don't duck us all we are not all bewitched.

Priest.
I tell you it each good for you an bee, and will defend you upon occasion.

Sir Ieff.
Now you see, Sir, with your own Eyes; cannot you give us a Receipt to make Holy-water?

Priest.
A Resheit, aboo, boo, boo; by my Shoule he is a Fool. I have ma••e


two Hogsheads gre: and I will have you vast all de Rooms vet it, and de Devil will not come upon de plaash by my Shalvaation.
Bell.
It is a little odd; but however, I shall not fly from my Belief, that every thing is done by Natural Causes, because I cannot presently assign those Causes.

Sir Adieu.
You are in the right, we know not the powers of matter.

Doubt.
When any thing unwonted happens, and we not see the cause, we call it unnatural and miraculous.

Priest.
By my Shoule you do talk like Heretick-Dogs, and Aathiests.

Sir Adieu.
Let us enquire farther about these Musicians.

Priest.

The Scene returns to Sir Edwards House.
Enter Bellfort and Doubty.
Bell.
My Dear Friend, I am so transported with excess of Joy, it is become a pain, I cannot bear it.

Doubt.
Dear Bellfort! I am in the same Case, but (if the hope transports us so) what will Enjoyment do?

Bell.
My Blood is chill, and shivers when I think on it.

Doubt.
One night with my Mistress would outweigh an Age of Slavery to come.

Bell.
Rather than be without a nights Enjoyment of mine, I would be hanged next morning: I am Impatient till they appear.

Doubt.
They are Women of Honour, and will keep their Words; your Parson's ready, and three or four of our Servants for Witnesses.

Bell.
He is so, it will be dispatched in half a quarter of an hour, all are retired to bed.

Enter Lady Shacklehead.
Doubt.
Go in, yonders my Lady-Mother-in-Law coming, I must contrive a way to secure her: in, in.

Bell.

Doubt.
Death, that this old Fellow should be asleep already! she comes now to discover, what I know too well already.

La. Sha.
He is there I'll swear, a punctual Gentleman, and a person of much honour; Sir, I am come according to your appointment; Sir Ieffery is fast.

Doubt.
It is before I expected, Madam, I thought to have left Bellfort asleep, who is a Jealous man, and believes there is an Intrigue betwixt your Ladyship and me.

La. Sha.
I vow: ha, ha, ha, me! no, no; ha, ha, ha.

Doubt.
Retire for a short time, and when I have secured him, I'll wait on you; but let it be in the dark.

La. Sha.
You speak like a Discreet and Worthy Person, remember this Room, there's no body lies in it; I will stay there in the dark for you.

Ex. Lady.
Doubt.
Your most humble Servant. Well, I will go to the Ladies Chamber as if I •istook it for mine, and let them know this is the time.

Enter Tongue O Divelly.
Priest.
Dere is shometimes de pretty Wenches, doe walk here in de dark at night, and by my Shoulvaation if I doe catch one, I will be after enjoying her Body: and feet and trot I have a great need too, it is a venial Sin, and I do not care.

Doubt.
Death, who is here? stay Ladies, here's the damned Priest in the way.

Enter Doubty with a Candle.


Isab.
Go you, we'll follow by and by in the dark.

The Ladies retire, Doubty goes to his Chamber.
Enter Lady Shacklehead.
La. Sha.
I hear one trampling, he is come already, sure Bellfort is asleep; who is there?

Priest.
By my Should it is a Women's speech, it is I; where are you? by my feet I will maak a Child upon her Body.

La. Sha.
Mr. Doubty.

Priest.
Ay, let me put a sweet Kish upon die hand Joy, and now I will Shalute die Mout, and I will embraash die Body too indeed.

La. Sha.
S'life, I am mistaken, this is the Irish Priest; his understanding is sure to betray him.

Ex. Priest and Witch.
Enter Lady.
La. Sha.
What's the meaning of this? he talked to some Woman, and kissed her too, and is retired into the Chamber I was in.

Enter Isab. and Theo.
Isab.
Every thing is quiet, I hear no noise.

Theo.
Nor I, this is the happy time.

La. Sha.
This must be he; who's there?

Theo.
S'life! this is my Mothers voice, retire softly.

Isab.
Oh Misfortune! What makes her here? we are undone if she discovers us.

La. Sha.
Whose there I say? will you not answer? what can this mean? it is not a Wench I hope for Doubty, and then I care not.

Isab. and Theo. retire.
Enter Priest and Witch.
I am impatient till he comes; ha, whom have we here? I am sure this is not he, he does not come that way.

Priest.
By my should Joy, dou art a Gaalant piece of Flesh, a braave Bedfellow, phoo art dou?

Susan.
O, Sir, are you there? I am going to Mr. Smirk with this Candle poor man.

Priest.
O phaat have I done? Oh! de Vich! de Vich!

The Witch sinks, she lets fall the Candle and Candle, and runs a∣way shrieking.
Susan.
Oh! the Witch! the Witch!

By my Shoule I have had communicaation and Copulaation too vet a Succubus; Oh! phaat will I do! phaat will I do! by my feet and trot, I did tought she had been a braave and gaallant Lady, and bee, oh! oh!

Ex. Priest.
Enter Lady Shacklehead.
La. Sha.
What shriek was that? hah! here's nobody, sure ell's clear now!

Enter Isabella, Theodosia.
Isab.
I heard a shriek, this is the time to venture, they are frighted out of the Gal∣lery, and ell's clear now.

Theo.
Let's venture; we shall have people stirring very early this morning to pre∣pare for the Wedding else.

La. Sha.
Ha! who's that?
Isab. and Theo. creep softly into Bell•forts and Doubty's Chamber.
I am terribly afraid: Heaven!
what's this! the Chamber door opened, and I saw a woman
〈◊〉 in, I am enraged, I'll distrub 'em.
Isabella, The dosia, Bellfort, Doubty disguised, Parson and Servants in the Chamber.

Isab.
You see we are women of words, and women of courage too, that dare venture upon this dreadful business.

Bell.
Welcome, more welcome than all the Treasures of the Sea and Land.

Doubt.
More welcome than a Thousand Angels.

Theo.
Death! we are undone, one knocks.

La. Shack, knocks.
Bell.
Curse on 'em; keep the door fast.

La. Sha.
Gentlemen open the door for Heavens sake, quickly.

Isab.
Open it, we are ruined else; we'll into the Bed, you know what you have to do.

They cover themselves. Enter La. Shacklehead.
La. Sha.
Gentlemen, the House is alarmed with Witches, and I saw two come into this Chamber, and come to give you notice.

Bell.
Here are none but whom you see.

Doubt.
They come invisibly then; for we had our eyes on the door.

La. Sha.
Are they not about the Bed somewhere? Let's search.

Bell.
There are no Witches there, I can assure you.

La. Sha.
Look a little, I warrant you.

Sir Jeffery knocks without.
Sir Ieff.
Open the door quickly, quickly, the Witches are there.

La. Sha.
Oh! my Husband, I am ruined if he sees me here.

Doubt.
Put out the Candles,

He enters, and stumbles up∣on the Servant.
lye down before the door.


Sir Ieff.
Oh! Oh! I have broken my knees; this is the Witches doing: I have loosed my Wife too: lights, lights there.

La. Sha.
Isle not stay here.

She creeps out softly.
Isab.
Here's no staying for us.

Theo.
Quickly, go by the Wall.

They steal on.
Sir Ieff.
For Heavens sake let's into the Gallery and call for lights.

Bell.
A Curse upon this Fellow and all ill luck.

Doubt.
Hell take him, the Ladies are gone too.


ACT. V.
Enter Bellfort and Doubty.
Bell.
WHat unfortunate disappointments have we met with!

Doubt.
All ill luck has conspired against us this night.

Bell.
We have been near being discovered, which would have ruined us.

Doubt.
And we have but this night to do our business in; if we dispatch not this af∣fair now, all will come out to morrow.

Bell.
I tremble to think on it; sure the surprise the Ladies were in before, has fright∣ed 'em from attempting again.

Doubt.
I rather think that they have met with people, in the Gallery, that have prevented 'em.

Bell.
Now I reflect, I am apt to think so too; for they seem to be very hearty in this matter. Once more go to their Chamber.

Doubt.
Go you in then to ours.

Bell. goes in.
Enter Lady Shacklehead.
La. Sha.
Hold, Mr. Doubty.

Doubt.
A Curse on all damned luck, is she here?

Aside.
Sweet Madam, is it you! I have been watching, for Bellfort's sleeping ever since.

La. Sha.
I venture hard, since Sir Ieffery missed me out of Bed, I had much ado to •asten an excuse upon him.

Doubt.
I am so afraid of Bellforts coming, Madam, he was here but even now: The hazard of your honour puts me in an Agony.

La. Sha.
O dear Sir, put out the Candle, and he can never discover any thing; be∣sides, we will retire into you Room.

Doubt.
Death, what shall I do now.

She puts out the Candle.
La. Sha.
And since it is dark, and you cannot see my Blushes, I must tell you, you are a very ill guesser; for I my self was the person I described.

Doubt.
Oh Madam! you rail me, I will never believe it while I live; it is impose∣sible.

La. Sha.
I'll swear it is true: Let us withdraw into that Room, or we shall be dis∣covered.


Oh Heaven, I am undone, my Husband with a light run into your Cham∣ber.
Doubt.
It is a happy deliverance.

Aside.
Ex. Doubty.
La. Sha.
I'll counterfeit walking in my sleep.

Enter Sir Jeffery with a Light.
Sir Ieff.
Where is this Wife of mine? She told me she fell asleep in the Closet, at her Prayers, when I mist her before; and I found her there at my coming back to my Chamber: But now she is not there I am sure. Ha! here she is. Ha, what is she blind! she takes no notice of me! how gingerly she treads!

La. Sha.
Oh! stand off—who's that would kill my dear Sir Ieffery? stand off I say.

Sir Ieff.
Oh Lord, kill me! where! ha! here's nobody.

La. Sha.
Oh! the Witch, the Witch, oh she pulls the clothes off me. Hold me, dear Sir Ieffery, hold me.

Sir Ieff.
On my Conscience and Soul she walks in her sleep.

La. Sha.
Oh, all the Clothes are off, cover me, oh I am so cold!

Sir Ieff.
Good lack a day, it is so! my Dear, my Lady.

La. Sha.
Hah, hah.

She opens her eyes and shri•ks.
Sir Ieff.
Wake I say, wake.

La. Sha.
Ah.

Sir Ieff.
It is I my dear.

La. Sha.
Oh Heaven! Sir Ieffery, where am I?

Sir Ieff.
Here in the Gallery.

La. Sha.
Oh! how came I here?

Sir Ieff.
Why, thou did walk in thy sleep; good lack a day, I never saw the like.

La. Sha.
In my sleep say you! oh Heaven! I have caught my death. Let's to Bed, and tell me the story there.

Sir Ieff.
Come on. Ha, ha, ha, this is such a jest! walk in your sleep! gods∣niggs, I shall so laugh at this in the morning.

La. Sha.
This is a happy come off.

Aside
Enter Isabella and Theodosia.
Isab.
If we do not get into this Chamber suddenly, we are undone: They are up in the Offices already.

Theo.
Never have adventures been so often disappointed, in so short a time.

Isab.
There's no body in the Gallery now, we may go.

Theo.
Hast then, and let us fly thither.

Isab. Theo.
Ah, what's this?

Just as they are entering, Chaplain and Su∣san enter with a Candle.
Susan.
Oh! the Witches, the Witches.

Smirk.
Oh mercy upon us, where is this Candle?

So let me tell you, It was no Witch; they were the two young Ladies, that frighted my dear beauteous Love so; and I'll acquaint their Parents with it I'll assure you.

Susan.
This is strange, what could they have to do at this time of the night!



Smirk.
I know not. But I well know what I have to do. I am inflamed beyond all measure, with thy heavenly beauty.

Susan.
Alas, my beauty is but moderate; yet none of the worst, I must needs say.

Smirk.
It is blasphemy to say so; your eyes are bright like two Twin-Stars; your Face is an Ocean of beauty; and your Nose a Rock arising from it, on which my heart did split; Nothing but Ruby and Pearl is about thee; I must blazon thee by Jewels, thy beauty is of a Noble rank.

Susan.
Good lack, what fine language is this! well, it is a rare thing to be a Scholar.

Smirk.
It is a miracle I should not think her handsome before this day; she is an Angel! Isabella is a Dowdy to her. You have an unexhausted mine of beauty. Dear Mrs. Susan cast thy Smiles upon me, and let me labour in thy Quarry: Love makes me Eloquent and Allegorical.

Susan.
Sweet Sir, you oblige me very much by your fine Language; but I vow I understand it not: yet methinks it goes very prettily.

Smirk.
I will unfold my hear unto thee; let me approach thy lip, Oh fragrant! fragrant! Arabia felix is upon this lip.

Susan.
Ha! upon my lip, what's that? I have nothing, I have no pimple, nor any thing upon my lip, not I.

Smirk.
Sweet Innocence—I will be plain; I am inflamed within, and would enjoy thy lovely Body in sweet dalliance.

Susan.
How Sir! do you pretend to be a Divine, and would commit this sin! know, I will preserve my Honour and my Conscience.

Smirk.
Conscience? why so you shall, as long as our minds are united. The Casu∣ists will tell you, it is a Marriage in foro 〈◊〉▪ and besides, the Church of Rome allows Fornication: And truly it is much practised in our 〈◊〉 too. Let us retire, come, come.

Susan.
Stand off, I defy you: your Casuists are Knaves, and you are a Papist, you are a foul voluptuous Sue•n•, and I will never smile on you more. Farewell.

Smirk.
Hold, hold, Dear, ••autious Creature, I am at thy mercy: Must I marry then? speak. Prithee spare me that, and I'll do any thing.

Susan.
Stand off, I scorn thy Love; thou art a piteous Fellow.

Smirk.
Dear Mrs. Susan hear me; let us but do the thing, and then I'll marry thee.

Susan.
I'll see thee hanged ever I'll trust thee, or ever a Whoremaster of you all. No, I have been served that trick too often already, I thank you.

Aside.
Smirk.
Must I then Marry?

Serve.
Why would you rise so soon? It is not day yet.

Sir Tim.
It is no matter, I cannot sleep man, I am to be Married Sirrah.

Serve.
Ay, and therefore you should have slept now, that you might watch the bet∣la at night: For it will be uncivil to sleep much upon your Wedding Night.

Enter Sir Jeffery with a Light.
Sir Ieff.
Heaven! What a Storm is this! The Witches and all their Imps are at work. Who are these? hah!—your Faces are all bloody.

Sir Tim.
We have been frighted out of our Wits; we have been assaulted by Witches in the shape of Cats, and they have scratcht us most ruefully.

Priest.
But I did fright dem away, by my Shoule.

Sir Ieff.
Why you are as much mauld as any one, nay, they are at work—I never remember such Thunder and Lightning; bid 'em ring out all the Bells at the Church.

Priest.
I vill[*] Baptise all your Bells for you Joy, and then they will stop the Tempest indeed, and not before; I tell you, oh, Baptised Bells are braave things feet.

Tom. Sha.
Flesh, Christen Bells!

Sir Tim.
Yes, I believe the great Bell at Oxford was Christened Tom.

Yo. Har.
And that at Lincoln has a Christen name too.

Priest.
I tell de Joy, I will carry de hosht and shome relics abroad, and we will get a black Chicken and maak one of de Vetches throw it into de Air, and it will maak stop upon de Tempest.

Sir Ieff.
Why, all the Authors say, [*] sacrificing a black Chicken so, will raise a Tempest.

Tho. Sha.
What's here a haund! uds Flesh, you see I have cut off a haund of one of the Hags.

Sir Ieff.
Let's see, this is a lucky evidence; keep it and see what Witch it will fit, and it is enough to hang her.

Priest.
The Storm begins to stay; I did shay shome Aves, and part of de Gospd of St. Iohn, and in fine, fugiat Tempests, and it does go away upon it indeed.

Tho. Sha.
We may trace her by her Blood.

Sir Tim.
But hark you, What's the reason my Hawks wanted their Pigeons: uds bud I shall remember you for it; you think to live like a Lubber here and do nothing.

Tom. Sha.
Peace, I was drunken, peace good Sir Timothy, Ayst do no more so.

Sir Ieff.
Methinks all on a sudden the Storm is laid.

Enter Servant.
Serve.
Sir, the Constable and the rest of us have taken the whole flock of Witches: but they fell upon us like Cats first; but we have beaten 'em into Witches, and now we have 'em fast.

Sir Ieff.
So now, their Power's gone when they are taken, let's go see 'em.

Yo. Har.
I'll wash my face and away a Hawking, now the Storm's over, it is broad day.

Sir Tim.
I will call up Sir Edward; Music, and wake the two Brides with a Sere∣nade this morning.

Ex. Omnia.


Enter Sir Edward and his man with a Light.
Sir Adieu.
It has been a dreadful Storm, and strangely laid of the sudden, this is a joyful day to me: I am now in hopes to strengthen and preserve my Family—my poor Daughter has the worst on it, but she is discreet; and will mould Sir Timothy to what she pleases: he is good nature, •, and he loves her, and his Estate's beyond Ex∣caption.— Go call my Son to me, bid him rise, it is day, put out the Candle now.

Ex. Servant.
This Son, I out of Duty must provide for; for there's a Duty from a Father to make what he begets as happy as he can; and yet this Fool makes me unhappy as he can: but that I call Philosophy to my aid, I could not bear him.
Enter Young Harfort and Servant.
How now, your Face scrach't! what were you drunk last night, and have been at Cuffs?

Yo. Har.
No, Sir Timothy, I, and Tongue O Devilly, and Tom. Shaklehead were as∣salted by Witches in the Shapes of Cats; and Tom. Shaklehead has cut off one of the Cats hands; and all the Witches are taken, and are in the Stable under a strong Guard.

Sir Adieu.
What foolish wild story is this? you have been drunk in Ale, that makes such foggy Dreams.

Yo. Har.
Sbud Sir, the story is true, you'll find it so.

Sir Adieu.
How now! what makes you booted upon your Wedding-day?

Yo. Har.
Why, I am going a Hawking this morning, and I'll come home time e∣nough to be married.

Sir Adieu.
Thou most incorrigible Ass, whom no precept or example can teach com∣mon sense to, that would have made thee full of Joy at thy approaching happiness; it would have filled thy mind, there could have been no room for any other object; to have a good Estate settled upon thee, and to be married to a woman of that Beauty, and that Wit and Wisdom, I have not known her equal, would have transported any one but such a clod of Earth as thou art: thou art an excrement broken from me, not my Son.

Yo. Har.
Why Sir, I am transported; but can't one be transported with Hawking too? I love it as I love my life, would you have a Gentleman neglect his sports?

Sir Adieu.
None but the vilest men will make their sports their business; their books, their friends, their kindred and their country should concern 'em: such drones serve not the ends of their Creation, and should be lopped of from the rest of men.

Yo. Har.
A man had better dye than leave his sport; tell me of books, I think theres nothing in 'em for my part; and for Music I had as live set in the stocks, as hear your fine songs; I love a Bagpipe well enough, but there's no Music like a ••up Mouthed Hound.

Sir Adieu.
Thou most excessive blockhead, thou art enough to embitter all my sweets; thou art a Wen belonging to me, and I shall do well to cut thee off: but do you hear Fool,



go and dress your self, and wait upon your Bride, or by Heaven I will disinherit you. This is the Critical day, on which your happiness or misery depends; Think on that.
Ex. Sir Edward.
Yo. Har.
Was ever so devilish a Father to make one neglect one's sport, because he's no sports-man himself; A Pox on Marrying, could not I Hawk and Marry too? well I am resolved I'll steal out after I am Married.

Enter Sir Timothy and Music.
Sir Tim.
Come on: Place your selves just by her Chamber and play—and sing that Song I love so well.

Song.
My Dear, my sweet, and most delicious Bride
Awake, and see thine own Dear waiting at thy Door;
Surely she cannot sleep for thinking of me, poor Rogue.
Isabela
above.
Who's this disturbs my rest! is it thou? I thought it was some Im∣pertinent Coxcomb or other; dost thou hear, carry away that scurvy Face from me as soon as possibly thou can.
Sir Tim.
Well, you have a pleasant way with you, you'll never leave your pretty humours, I see that.

Isab.
Ha! Thou hast been scratching with Wenches, was not thy face ugly e∣nough, but thou must disfigure it more than Nature has done? one would have thought that had don't enough.

Sir Tim.
Faith thou art a pretty wag, Thou It never leave thy Roguery; Wenches, why it was done by Witches, who in the shape of Cats, had like to have killed us: your Brother, my Uncle, and the Irish man are all as bad as I.

Isab.
Prithee begone, and mend thy Face, I cannot bear it.

Sir Tim.
Ay, ay, it's no matter, I'll come into thy Chamber, I must be simile•are with you—

Isab.
And I will be very free with you; you are a Nauseous Fool and you shall no∣ver come into my Chamber. •S life, would your begin you Reign before you are Mar∣ry'd? no, I'll dominere now—begone.

Ex. Isabela.
Sir Tim.
Nay, faith I'll not leave you so, you little Cross Rogue you; open the door there, let me in, let me in I say.

Theodosia comes out in a Weitches habit and a Viz•r.
Theo.
Who's that? Thou art my love, come into my arms.

Sir Tim.
Oh the Witch! the Witch! help,

He runs out, Theodosia retires.

Sir Ieff.
So, Now thou art come, my Dear, I'll dispatch the Witches, they are all taken and Guarded in the stable: Clod, bid 'em bring em all hither.

La. Sha.
That's well, are they caught? let 'em come before us, we will order 'em.

Constak.
Did not you say to my Wife you would be revenged on me? and has not she be•n struck with pain in her rump-bone ever since? and did not my Sow cast her farrow last Night?

Harg.
You should send your Brother to Goal for cutting my hand off.

Bell.
I should have had a greater share in any Joy that could affect so worthy a man, had not your Daughter been the only Person, I ever saw, whom I could have fixed my love upon; but I am unhappy that I had not the honour to know you till it was to late.

Sir Adieu.
This had been a great honour to me, and my Daughter, and I am sorry I did not know it sooner, and assure you it is some trouble upon me.

Doubt.
How like a Gentleman he takes it, but I have an Ass, Nay two, to deal with.

Enter Lady Shacklehead, and Isabella, and Theodosia.

Sir Adieu.
How!

Serve.
It is true.

Sir Adieu.
I am sorry for it, that Chaplin is a Rascal—I have found him out, and will turn him away—

Enter another Servant.
Serve.
Sir, here are some of your Tenants and Country men come to be merry with you, and have brought their Piper and desire to dance before you.

Enter several Tenants, and Ccuntry Fellows.
Tenants.
We are come to wish your Worship, my Young Master and Lady Joy of this happy day.

Sir Adieu.
You are kindly welcome Neighbours, this is happiness indeed, to see my Friends, and all my loving Neighbours thus about me.

All.
Heavens bless your good Worship.

Sir Adieu.
These honest men are the strength and sinews of our Country; such men as these are uncorrupted, and while they stand to us we fear no Papists, nor French invasion; this day we will be merry together.

Clod.
Ayst make bold to Dance for joy.

Sir Adieu.
Prithee do—

Clod Dances.
Go bid the Parson come in, we will dispatch this business here before you all.
Isab.
Hold, there needs no Parson.

Sir Adieu.
What say you?

Sir Ieff.
How!

Isab.
We are Married already, and desire your blessing.

Sir Adieu.
It is impossible.

Bell. Doubt. Isab. and Theo. kneel.
La. Sha.
Heaven! what's this I see?



Sir Ieff.
Thieves! Robbers! Murderers of my honour, I'll hang that Fellow.

Sir Adieu.
What pageantry is this? explain your self.

Sir Tim.
What a Devil do they mean now!

Bell.
The truth is Sir, we are Married; we found you Fathers were too far engaged to break off: I 〈◊〉 forced us to this way, and nothing else can be a fit excuse.

Smirk.
We have designed this ever since last Summer, and any other but a private way, had certainly prevented it. Let excess of love excuse our fault, Sir Ieffery, I will exceed what s•tlement was made upon your Daughter.

Bell.
An! I will, Sir, do the same Right to yours.

Sir Ieff.
Flesh and Heart—I'll Murder her.

〈◊〉
Hold Sir, she is mine now; I beseech you moderate your passion.

La. Sha.
Oh vile Creature; I'll tear her Eyes out.

〈◊〉
Forbear good Madam: What cannot be redressed must be past by—

La. Sha.
Thou worst of Thieves, thou know I can ne'er pass it by.

Sir Ieff.
Sir Edward, you may do what you will, but I'll go in and meditat• revenge.

La. Sha.
And I—

Ex. Sir Ieffery and Lady.
Sir Tim.
Hold, hold me, I am bloody minded, and shall commit Murder else; my honour, my honour, I must kill him, hold me fast, or I shall kill him.

Yo. Har.
For my part Cousin, I wish you Joy, for I am resolved to hunt and hawk, and course as long as I live—

Sir Tim.
Cruel Woman, I did not think you would have served me so; I shall •un mad, and hang my self an• walk.

Priest.
Now fear is de soleedity of all dish—phy all each paasht▪ and what will you say now? You must taak shome Consolaation unto you—Dou must Fornicaate vet die Mothers Maid sharvants; and daat is all one by my shoule.

Sir Adieu.
Hold, Gentlemen, who Married you?

Bell.
This Gentleman, who is under his gray Coat, my Parson.

Sir Adieu.
It is something unhospitable.

Bell.
I hope Sir, you'll not have cause to repent it; had there been any other way for me to have escaped perpetual misery, I had not taken this.

Sir Adieu.
But you Sir have most Iniurd me.

Doubt.
I beg a thousand pardons, Though I must have perished if I had not done it.

Theo.
It is no injury Sir, I never could have loved your Son; we must have been unhappy.

Isab.
And I had been miserable with Sir Timothy.

Yo. Har.
To say truth, I did not much care for her neither, I had rather not marry.

Sir Adieu.
Eternal Blockhead! I will have other means to preserve my Name: Gentlemen, your are men of ample Fortunes and worthy Families—Sir I wish you happiness with my Daughter, take her.

Bell.
You have given me more than my own Father did, then life and fortune.

Have they told all, I am ruined? good Sir, continue me your Chaplin, and I will Do and Preach whatever you command me.

Sir Adieu.
I'll not have a Divine with so flexible a Conscience, there shall be no such Vipers in my Family; I will take care you never shall have Orders. But she has served me well, and I will give her a Farm of 40. l. per annum to Plow: Go Sir, it was an Office you were born to.

EPILOGUE, By Mrs. BARRY and TONGUE.
Mrs. Barry.
A Skilful Mistress uses wondrous Art,
To keep a peevish crazy Lovers Heart,
His awkward Limbs forgetful of Delights,
Must be urged on by Tricks and Painful Nights:
Which the poor Creature is content to bear,
Fine Manteau's and new Petticoats to wear.
And Sirs, your sickly Appetites to raise,
Yhe starving Players try a thousand ways.
Tou had a Spanish Fryer of Intrigue,
And now we have presented you a Tongue;
Which with much cost from Ireland we have got,
If he be dull, even hang him for the Plot.
Tongue.
Now have a care, for by my Should shalwaation.
Dish will offend a Party in de Naation.
Mrs. Barry.
They that are angry must be very Beasts,
For all Religions laugh at foolish Priests.
Tongue.
By Creesh, I swear, de Poet has undone me,
Some simple Tory will maake beat upon me.
Mrs. Barry.
Good Protestants, I hope you will not see,
A Martyr made of our poor Tony Leigh.
Our Popes and Fryers on one side offend,
And yet alas the City's not our Friend:
The City neither like us nor our Wit.
They say their Wives learn ogling in the Pit.[*]
They are from the Boxes taught to make advances,
To answer stolen Sighs and naughty Glances.
We Virtuous Ladies some new way must seek,
For all conspire our playing Trade to break.
If the bold Poet freely shows his Vein,
In every place the snarling •ops complain,
Of your gross follies if you will not hear,
With inoffensive Nonsense you must bear.
You, like the Husband, never shall receive,
Half the delight the sportful Wife can give.
A Poet dares not whip this foolish Age,
You cannot bear the Physic of the Stage.
    The End.



[a] This is a solemn description of a fit time for Witches to be at work.
[b] The Spindle or Wheel is used in the•s conjurations. M•rtial makes it used for troubling the Moon, lib. 9. Ep. 3. Quae nuns Thessalico 〈◊〉 did •cere•rhom 〈◊〉 lib. 2. Ep. 67. Cum sect Cho•co Luna Vapulat rhombo, Lucan who of all the Poets writes with th• •oct admirable height about Witchcraft in his sixth Book, makes the Wheel or Spindle to be used in •••ve matters, Traxerunt torte Magica v•rtigine sly, as does, Ovid lib. 1. Eleg. 8. Se• •en quid grames 〈…〉 licia, &c. And so Propertius, lib. 3. Staminea rhombi d•citu• •rota. And lib. 2. D•ficiunt Magico torte sub c•rmine rhombi.
[c] The groaning of Mandrakes is a tradition of old women, and that the groan kill•. See the Notes in the Third Act, it has been always thought of great use in Magic.
[d] For choosing Ditches for their Magic rights, Ovid Metam. lib. 7. 〈…〉 procul egesta scrobibus •allure du•k•• 〈◊〉 facet. For scraping holes with their 〈…〉 lib. 1. Satyr 8. concerning Ca•••lia, and Sag•na scalper terram 〈◊〉 And it is used by our modern Witch•, as you shall find in Mall•s Mall•••arum, Bodin, Remigius, Delrio, &c. Il. lib. 3. 〈◊〉 M•gicarum, Sect. 4. de s•gitarii 〈◊〉 is et imaginum fabica•orum Malefic•s tells man, st••ies of their using
[e] Images, he says, H••d mule••• a sagittarii• 〈…〉 imagines quas vel ac•bus p•e•ngunt•vel eg•e liq ••ned vel confringunt, &c. See 〈◊〉 B•e•h, the H•sto•y of King Duff, lib. 3. rer•m Scotica••m Corn. Tacit. Ann. 2d de 〈◊〉 pi∣sonis et morte 〈◊〉, say•, rep•rieba•tur 〈…〉 humanorun c•rporum reliquiae carmi∣na et devotions 〈…〉 Quae mover ceroas ima•ins, Ovid, Amor. 7. Eleg. 6. Sagave punicea de fixit nominee cera.
[f] Ovid ibid, et medium te••es in jecur urget acus 〈◊〉. Ep. before quoted, following that Verse, Et mis•rum tenues in jecur urget acus. See Bodin. Daemonoman. lib. 2. Cap. 8. a great deal of stuff to this purpose. One in my memory had this kind of Witchcraft sworn against her at the Old-Bayley, before Steel, Recorder of London,
[g] Whore. lib. 1. Satyr 8. de Canidia & Sagan•• pullam dveillere mordicus agnam caeperunt, Ovid metam. 7 cultros{que} in guttur velleris atri conjucit et patulas perfundit sanguine fosses.
[h] All Witches, ancient and modern, are said to have one pre•iding at their convene∣tions which they honour with a title. Apuleius mentions the Regina sagarum & Delrio, Disqu. Mag. lib. 2. quest. 9. and this is found in all late examinations of Witches.
[i] Debar is said to be the Demon of the night, that flies about and does mischief, and principally in Tempests, Pet. de Loyer de spectres in English, page 14. And Bodin, lib. 2. cap. 4. says, Debar is the Daemon of the night, and Chel•b of the day.
[k] For their rights in their imaginary raising of Storm•. see Bod. lib. 2. cap. 8. Remig••s D••∣molat, lib. 1. cap. 25. and cap. 29. also Delrio, lib. 2. Quest. 1. enumerates a great many odd rites (different from the following.) For troubling the Air, and bringing darkness, Thunder, Rain, Hail, &c. see Nider in his Formicarium, cap. 4. O laus de gentibus sep•e n•rionlibus, lib. 3. sub titu•o de ma∣gis et Maleficis Finnorum, also Mall•us Maleficarum. Wierus de praest, Daem. lib. 3. cap. 16. describes at large the way of raising a Storm. Speaking of the illusions of the Devil towards Witches, he says, 〈◊〉 •as instruit ut quando{que} silices post tergum occidentem versus pro•iciant aliquando ut araenam aqua tor∣rentis in aerem projiciant plerum{que} scopes in aquam in tingant coelum{que} versus spargant vel fossula facta et lotio iufuso vel aqua digitum (others say, digitum vel baculum) comoveant subinde in olla porcorum pilos (or as others say, Setas porcinas) bulliant no••unquam trabes vel ligna in ripa transverse collocant, See Scott. p. 60. he adds the use of rotten Sage.
[l] Lucan, lib. 6. Miratur Erictho has satis licuisse moras 〈…〉 verberat immotum vivo serpent cadaver, I use live Serpents here upon another occasion.
[m] For these confu∣sed noises Lucan in the same Book, Tun• vox Letheis cunctis polleutior herbs excantare Deos 〈◊〉 murmura brimum dissona et humane multum discordia lingu•e latratus habit isle canum gemitus▪ L•∣po∣rum quad trepidus bubo quote strix nocturne queruntur quote strident vlulant{que} ferae quote sibilat anguis &c. To• rerum vox una fuit: See the latter part of the Notes in the second Act, about the raising ot Tem∣pests; if you be so curious you may find something in all Authors that treat of Witches, and many of 'em mention one Ericus •ing of Sue•en, who, as they believe, could do it by magic, as does Delrio, R••igi••, and Lord••igus, 〈◊〉 Daemonomagiae, Qu•stio 6. Silvest. Priories de ord. prae licatorum de strigi∣magic, Discourses of the power of Witches in raising Storms: and G•accius compendium maleficarum, 〈◊〉, Bartholom•us Sp••eus and many more.
[*] One of the Witches flies away with the Candle and Lantern, Mother Demdike sets him upon the top of a Tree, and they all fly away Laughing.
[*] Burchard Decret. amongst his questions about Confession, where this is found, Fecisti quote quaedam mu∣lieres facere solent Tollunt Piscem vivum & mittunt eum in puerperium suum & tam dive eum ibi teneant douec mortuus fuerit & decocto pisce vel assato merits suis ad comedendum tradunt ideo faciunt hoc ut 〈◊〉 in amorem earum exardescant: si fecisti duos aunos per Legitimise ferries peniteas. For the Knots, Verge. Eclogue. 8. Nest tribus nodi• ternos Amarilli colours, nectae Amarilli modo, & Veneris, dic vincula necto.
[a] They call that Devil that calls them to their Sabbaths or Feasts, Little Martin, or little Master, Delrio Disquis, Mag, quest. 16. lib. 2. and Bodin Doemonoman, lib. 2. cap. 4. have the same relation out of Paul••s Grillandus, H• is said to call them with a human voice, but to appear in the shape of a Buck-Goat; •vocabatur voce quadam valued humane ab ipso daemo•e qu•m non la doemonem sed magisterulum 〈◊〉 M•rtinett•m Hunc five Martinellum. And a little after, Et statim hircus ille ascendebat per aerem, &c. Almost all Authors that speak of Witches Sabaths, say, that he is called Martine••us or Magisterulus▪ and that he appears in form of a Buck-Goat: about their Sabath. See Nichola•• Remigiu, lib. 1. cap. 14. Philippo Ludwig. Elich. Daemonomagi•, Quest. 10. Sol•ut ad conventum delat Lemi•• D•emo∣name: Synagogae praesidem & rectorem in solio considentem immutatum in Hircum horridum: Guaccius compendium Maloficarum, Lib. 1. cap. 13. Ibi Daemon est conventus praises in solio sedet form terrifica ut plurinum Hero, &c.
[b] Kissing the Devils Buttucks is a part of the homage they pay the Devil, as 〈◊〉 says Doctor Edlin did, a Sorbon Doctor, who was burned for a Witch. Scot also quotes our Dane∣us, whom 〈◊〉 never read, for kissing the Devils Buttocks. About kissing the Devils Buttocks, see farther, Guaccius in the forequoted Chapter, Ad signum homagii eum (sc. daemonem) in podice osculan•ur 〈◊〉 Eli•h quest 10▪ Deinde quote homagii est indicum (honour sit Aurbus) ab ijs in gerenda sunt os∣cula Daemouis po•ici.
[c] The Devil will have no Salt in his Meat, Lord••igus Elich. Quest. 7. p. 113. A• also Guess•u, cap. 13. The Devil loves no Salt in his Meat, says Bodin, Daem. lib. 3. cap. 5. because it is an emblem of 〈◊〉 and used by Gods command in Sacrifices, and quotes Levit. 1. for that, which is a notable reason.
[d] Lucian in his Dialogue of 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, or the Lovers of lies (〈◊〉 Witchmong∣ers are) makes one of his Sages Ecrotes tell how he learned of Pa•crates an Egiptian Magician that travelled with him, to make a St•ff run of Errands and bring things to him, and that he in the absence of the Magician commanded a Staff to fetch him Water, and not having learned the art of conjuring it down again, it brought Water so often that he feared it would have drowned the Room; he cut 〈◊〉 in two pieces, and then both those pieces fetched Water till the Egiptian came and conjured 'em down▪
[e] They are always at their me•ings examined by the Devil, or the Dame, what service they have done. Remigius Daemonolat. lib. 1. cap. 22. Quem admodum solent Heri in Villicis procuratoribus, &c. Ita Da∣mon in suis comitiis quote tempus examinandis cujus{que} rebus & actionibus ipse constituit, &c. Speaking of Witches.
[f] See Malleus Male•icarum, Tom. 2. of Witches being transformed into Cats and •ac•∣ing the breath and blood of Children.
[g] Ovid Fast. lib. 6. say• of Striges, which modern Witchmonger• call Witches, No•te volant pueros{que} petunt nutricis agents & vi•iant cunis corpora rapt sui• (〈◊〉 di••untur lactentia viscera ros•it is & plenum poto sanguine guttur habent Wier•s, lib. ultim• de lam••s, 〈◊〉. 6• relates f•om one 〈◊〉 a Judge• in Boltingen, a place in the Country of B•rn, the con••ssion of a Witch thus, Infant•buy baptizatis vel nondum baptizatis insidiamur, &•. hos in cunabulis vel ad 〈…〉 la clam suffuramur & in olla decoquimus de solidiore materia 〈◊〉 facimus 〈…〉 actibus & transvectionibus commodum de liquidiore vero humour utrem implemus ex quo quicun{que} bi∣berit: See the Notes in the third Act.
[h] Remigius, lib. 2. Daemonolat. cap. 3. Haec & nostrae aeta•is 〈◊〉 hominibus moris est facere praesertim si cujus supplicio affecti cadaver Exemplo datum est, & in crucem sublatum name non solum inde sortilegijs suis materiam muteriam mutuantur sed & abipsis carnificinae in∣strumentis rest vinculis polo ferramentis siquidem eec velgi etiam opinion in•sse ad incantations mag•∣cas. vim quondam & potestatem. The French Gamesters are superstitious in this, and think that t•e noose of the Rope, that went about the Neck of one that was hanged will make them win. And here old women will prescribe a piece of the Gallows for a cure for an ague. That the ancients were super∣stitious in these thing, see Lucan, lib. 6. La•ueum nod•s{que} nocentes ore suo rupit, pend•ntia corpor a carp∣sit abrasit{que} cruces percusa{que} viscera nimbis v•list & incoctas admisso sole medullas, insertum 〈…〉, nigram{que} per artus stillantis tabi saniem virus{que} coactum sustulit & morsus nervo retinente pependi•. For the use of dead bodies in Witchcraft see Apuleius, De aureo 〈◊〉, lib. 3. speaking of 〈◊〉 Prius{que} apparatu solito instruxit feralem officinam. Among other things, Sepultorum cadaverum expo∣sitis mule•is admodum••members hic nares illic digiti, illic carnosi clavi pendentium, alibi trucidatorum 〈…〉
[i] Lucan makes his Witch inhabit such places, Desert{que} bust incolit & 〈◊〉 obe•indeed umbris. Agrippa de occulta Philosophia, lib. 1. cap. 48. Saturno correspondent 〈◊〉 fetida tenebrosa s•bterranea religiosa funesta ut coemiteria bust & hominibus desert habitacu∣la & vetustate caduca loca obscure & horrenda & solitary a•tra, cavernae, pu•ei, &c.

[l] Nider in his For∣micarlum mentions one that killed Seven Children in the Mothers Womb, by Witchcraft: This, he says, was done by laying • Lizard under the Th•eshold, and that will cause abortion in every Female in the Ho•se: Vide Form •are. cap. 3. Remigius says oboe•t the Cocks-crowing, that nothing is so hateful to the Witches when they are at their Charms, as the Cock-crowing; as one Latoma a Witch, among other things confessed; and several other Authors mention, it as very hateful to the Witches.
[m] •or. Epod. 5. amongst Canidias materials reckons, Ossa ab ore rapt jejune Canis. And Lucan▪ •ib. 6. of Erictho. Et quodcun{que} jacet nude tellure cadaver ante feras vulucres{que} sedet; nec carper• membra vult ferro minibus{que} suis morsus{que} luporum expectat siccis rapture a faucibus artu•.

You may see Lucan make• Erictho raise a Ghost, Seneca's untrix in He•c. O•teus: And T•resias in Oedipus do the same, all Witchmongers are full of it. In Bodin Daemon. lib. 2. cap. 6. There is a great deal of stuff about Transformations; he says, Witches transform themselves into Wolves, and others into Asses; and I think those are they that be∣lieve im 'em: He is very angry with Physicians that call •ycanthropia disease; he says, divers Witches at Vernon turned themselves into Cats, and tells a story of three Witches at A•gentine that turned the•∣selves into Cats, and beat and wounded a Faggot-maker. This also Petr. de Lover de spectres mentions in English Translation, p. 128. He says there, that in his time a Hermit of Do•e was turned into a Wo•• and was going to devour a little Child, if he had not been surprif•d and discovered; and a Merchant o• Cyprus was turned into as Ass; indeed, he says, the Devil does not change the body, but only abuse and delude the fancy; and quotes Thomas Equines in 2 〈◊〉. distinct. 8. Aug. lib 18. de Civit. Dei, says, he himself knew the Father of one 〈◊〉 who was changed into Mule, and did carry upon hi•• back Bag and Baggage for Soldiers; but he says this was an illusion of the Devil, and that the Father of 〈◊〉 was not really changed into a Mule, but the eyes of the beholders were enchanted.
