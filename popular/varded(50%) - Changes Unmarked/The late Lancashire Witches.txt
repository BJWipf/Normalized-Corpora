THE PROLOGVE.
COrrantoes sailing, and no foot post l•…te
Possessing us with New; of foreign State,
No accidents abroad worthy Relation
Arriving here, we are forced from our own Nation
To ground the Scene that's now in agitation.
The Project unto many here well known;
Those Witches the fat Jailer brought to Town,
An Argument so thin, persons so low
Can neither yield much matter, nor great show.
Expect no more than can from such be raised,
So may the Scene posse pardon•…d, though•… not praised.



ACTVS, I. SCENA, I.
Enter Master Arthur, Mr. Shakstone, Mr. Bantam: (as from hunting.)
Arthur.
WAs ever sport of expectation,
Thus crossed in th▪ height.
Shake.
Tush these are accidents, all game is (subject to.

Arth.
So you may call them
Chances, or cross•…es, or what else you please,
But for my part, Isle hold them prodigies,
As things transcending Nature.
Bantam.
O you speak this,
Because a Hare hath crossed you.
Arth.
A Hare? a Witch, or rather a Devil I think▪
For tell me Gentlemen, was it possible
In such a fair course, and no covert near,
We in pursuit, and she in constant view,
Our eyes not wandering but all bent that way,
The Dogs in chase, she ready to be ceased,
And at the instant, when I durst have laid
My life to gage, my Dog had pinched her, then
To vanish into nothing!
Shake.
Somewhat strange, but not as you enforce it,

Arth.
Make it plain
That I am in an error, sure I am
That I about me have no borrowed eyes.
They are mine own, and Matches.
Bant.
She might find some Muse as •…hen not visible to us,
And escape that way.
Shake.
Perhaps some Fox had earthed there,


And though it be not common, for I seldom
Have known or heard the like, there squat her self,
And so her escape appear but Natural,
Which you proclaim a Wonder.
Arth.
Well well Gentlemen, be y•…u of your own faith, but (what I see
And is to me apparent, being in sense,
My wits about me, no way tossed nor troubled,
•…o that will I give credit.
Banth.
Come, come, all men
Were never of one mind, nor I of yours.
Shake
To leave this argument, are you resolved
Where we shall dine to day?
Arth.
Yes where we purposed.

Banth.
That was with Master Generous.

Arth.
True, the same.
And where a loving welcome is presumed,
Whose liberal Table's never unprepared,
Nor he of guests unfurnish, of his means,
There's none can bear it with a braver port,
And keep his state unshaken, one who sells not
Nor covets he to purchase, holds his own
Without oppressing others, always pressed
To indeere to him any known Gentleman
In whom he finds good parts.
Bantham.
A Character not common in this age.

Arth.
I cannot wind him up
Unto the least part of his noble worth.
It is far above my strength.
Enter Whetstone.
Shake.
See who comes yonder,
A fourth, to make us a full Mess of guests
At Master Generous Table.
Arth.
Tush let him posse,
He is not worth our luring, a mere Coxcomb,
It is a way to call our 〈◊〉 its in question,
To have him seen amongst us.
Bant.
He hath spied us, there is no way to evade him.

Arth.
That's my grief; a most notorious liar, out upō him.


Shake.
Let's set the best face on it.

Whet.
What Gentlemen? all mine old acquaintance?
A whole triplicity of friends together? nay then
It is three to one we shall not soon part Company.
Shake.
Swcet Mr. Whetstone.

Bant.
Dainty Mr. Whetstone.

Arth.
delicate Master Whetstone.

Whet.
You say right, Mr. Whetstone I have bin, Mr. Whet∣stone I am, and Mr. Whetstone I shall be, and those that know me, know withal that I have not my name for nothing, I am he whom all the brave Blades of the Country use to whet their wits upon; sweet Mr. Shakton, dainty Mr. Bantham, and dainty Mr. Arthur, and how, and how, what all lustick, all froligozone? I know, you are going to my Uncles to dinner, and •…o am I too, What shall we all make one rendezvous there,

You need not doubt of your welcome.

Shake.
No doubt at all kind Mr. Whetstone; but we have not seen you of late, you are grown a great stranger amongst us, I desire sometimes to give you a visit; I pray where do you lye?

Whet.
Where doe I lye? why sometimes in one place, and then again in another, I love to shift lodgings; but most con∣stantly, wheresoever I dine or sup, there doe I lye?

Arth.
I never heard that word proceed from him
I durst call truth till now.
Whet.
But where so ever I lye it is no matter for that,
I pray you say, and say truth, are •…ot you three now
Going to dinner to my Uncles?
Bant.
I think you are a Witch Master Whetstone.

Whet.
•…ow? A Witch Gentlemen? I hope you doe not mean to abuse me, though at this time (if report be true there are too many of them here in our Country) but I am sure I look like no such ugly Creature.

Shake.
It seems then you are of opinion that there are Wit∣ches, for mine own part, I can hardly be induced to think there 〈◊〉 any such kind of people.

Whet.
No such kind of people! I pray you tell me Gentle∣men, did never any one of you know my Mother?


Arth.
Why was your Mother a Witch?

Whet.
I doe not say as Witches go now a days, for they for the most part are ugly old Belda•…s, but she was a lusty young Lass, and by her own report, by her beauty and fair looks bewitched my Father.

Bant.
It seems then your Mother was rather a young wan∣ton wench, than an old withered witch.

Whet.
You say right, and know withal I come of two an∣cient Families, for as I am a Whetstone by the Mother-side, so I am a By-blow by the Fathers.

Arth.
It appears then by your discourse, that you came in at the window.

Whet.
I would have you think I scorn like my Granams
Cat to leap over the Hatch.
Shake.
He hath confessed himself to be a Bastard.

Arth.
And I believe it as a notorious truth.

Whet.
Howsoever I was begot, here you see I am,
And if my Parents went to it without fear or wit,
What can I help it.
Arth.
Very probable, for as he was got without fear,
So it is apparent he was borne without wit.
Whet.
Gentlemen, it seems you have some private business amongst your selves, which I am not willing to interrupt, I know not how the day goes with you, but for mine own part, my stomach is now much upon 12. You know what hour my Uncle keeeps, and I love ever to bee set before the first grace, I am going before, speak, shall I acquaint him with your coming after?

Shake
We mean this day to see what fare he keeps.

Whet.
And you know it is his custom to fare well,
And in that respect I think I may be his kinsman,
And so farewell Gentlemen, Isle be your fore-runner,
To give him notice of your visit.
Bant.
And so entire us to you.

Shake.
Sweet Mr. Whetstone.

Arth.
Kind Mr. Bible•…w.

Whet.
I see you are perfect both in my name & surname; I have 〈◊〉 ever bound unto you, for which I will at this time be your



Noverint, and give him notice that you Universe will bee with him per praesentes, and that I take to be presently.
Exit.
Arth.
Farewell As in present.

Shake.
It seems he's piece of a Scholar.

Arth.
What because he hath read a little Scriveners Latin, he n•…ver proceeded farther in his Accidence than to Mentiri non est meum; and that was such a hard Lesson to learn, that he stuck at meant•…ri; and cu'd never reach to non est meum: since, a mere Ignaro, and not worth acknowledgement.

Bant.
Are these then the best parts he can boast of?

Arth.
As you see him now, so shall you find him ever: all in one strain, there is one only thing which I wonder he left our.

Shake.
And what might that be:

Arth.
Of the same affinity with the rest.
At every second word, he his commonly boasting
either of his Aunt or his Uncle.
Enter Mr. Generous.
Bant.
You name him in good time, see where he comes.

Goner.
Gentlemen, Welcome, it is a word I use,
From me expect no further complement:
Nor do I name it often at one meeting,
Once spoke (to those that understand me best,
And know I always purpose as I speak)
Hath ever yet sufficed: so jet it you;
Nor doe I love that common phrase of guests,
As we make bold, or we are troublesome,
Wee take you unprovided, and the like;
I know you understanding Gentlemen,
And knowing me, cannot persuade your selves
With me you shall be troublesome or bold,
But still provided for my worthy friends,
Amongst whom you are lifted.
Arth.
Noble sir, you generously instruct us, and to expr•…sse
We can be your apt scholars: in a word
Wee come to dine with you.
Goner.
And Gentlemen, such plainness doth best please me, I had notice
Of so much by my kinsman, and to show


How lovingly I took it, instantly
Rose from my chair to meet you at the gate.
And be my self your usher; nor shall you find
Being set to meat, that i'll excuse your fare,
Or say, I am sorry it falls out so poor;
And had I known your coming weed have had
Such things and such, nor blame my Cooke, to say
This dish or that hath not bin sauc'st with care:
Words, fitting best a common Hostess mouth,
When ther's perhaps some just cause of dislike
But not the table of a Gentleman;
Nor is it my wives custom; in a word, take what you find, & so
Arth.
Sir without flattery
You may be called the sole surviving son
Of long since banished Hospitality.
Goner.
In that you please me not: But Gentlemen
I hope to be beholden unto you all,
Which if I prove, Isle be a grateful debtor.
Bant.
Wherein good sir.

Goner.
I ever studied plainene•…e, and truth withal.

Shake.
I pray express your self.

Goner.
In few I shall. I know this youth to whom my wife is Aunt
Is (as you needs must find him) weak and shallow:
Dull, as his name, and what for kindred sake
We note not, or at least, are loath to see,
Is unto such well-knowing Gentlemen
Most grossly visible: If for my sake
You will but seem to wink at these his wants,
At least at table before us his friends,
I shall receive it as a curtsy
No•… soon to be forgot.
Arth.
Presume it sir.

Goner.
Now when you please pray Enter Gentlemen.

Arth.
Would these my friends prepare the way before,
To be resolved of one thing before dinner
Would something add unto mine appetite,
Shall I entreat you so much.



Bant.
O sir you may command us.

Goner.
In the mean time
Prepare your stomachs with a bowl of Sack.
My Cellar can afford it; now Mr. Arthur
Pray freely speak your thoughts.
Exit Bant. & Shake.
Arth.
I come not sir
To press a promise from you, tak't not so,
Rather to prompt your memory in a motion
Made to you not long since.
Goner.
Wast not about
A Manor, the best part of your estate,
Mortgaged to one slips no advantages
Which you would have redeemed.
Arth.
True sir the same.

Goner.
And as I •…think, I promised at that time
To become bound with you, or if the usurer
(A base, yet the best title I can give him)
Perhaps should question that security,
To have the money ready. Wast not so?
Arth.
It was to that purpose wee discoursed.

Goner.
Provided, to have the Writings in my custody.
Else how should I secure mine own es•…e.
Arth.
To deny that I shoe•…d appear •…of the World
Stupid, and of no brain.
Goner.
Your monie's ready,

Arth.
And I remain a man obliged to you.
Beyond all utterance.
Goner.
Make then your word good
By speaking it no further, only 〈◊〉▪
It seems your Uncle you trusted in so far
Hath failed your expectation.
Arth.
Sir he hath, not that he is unwilling or unable.
B•…t at 〈◊〉 time •…fit to be so•…cited;
For to the Co•…ries wonder and my sor•…ow,
•…ee is much to be pitied.
Goner.
Why I entreat you.

Arth.
Because he's late become the sole discourse

Page [unnumbered]

Of all the country; for of a man respected
For his discretion and known gravity,
As master of a governed Family,
The house (as if the ridge were fixed below,
And groundfils lifted up to make the roof)
All now turned topsy turvy,
Goner.
Strange, but how?

Arth.
In such a retrograde & preposterous way
As seldom hath hen heard of. I think never.
Goner.
Can you discourse the manner?

Arth.
The good man, in all obedience kneels unto his son,
He with an austere brow commands his father.
The wife presumes not in the daughters sight
Without a prepared curtsy. The girl, she
Expects it as a duty; chides her mother
Who quakes and trembles at each word she speaks,
And what's as strange, the Maid she domineers
O'er her young mistress, who is awed by her.
The son to whom the Father creeps and bends,
Stands in as much fear of the groom his man.
All in such rare disorder, that in some
As it breeds pity, and in others wonder;
So in the most part laughter▪
Goner.
How think you might this come.

Arth.
It is thought by Witchcraft.

Goner.
They that think so dream,
For my belief is, no such thing can be,
A madness you may call it: Dinner stays;
That done, the best part of the afternoon
We'll spend about your business.
Exeunt.
Enter old Seely and Doughty
Seely.
Nay but understand me neighbor Doughty.

Doughty.
Good master Seely I do understand you, and over and over understand you so much, that I could e'ene blush at your fondness; and had I a son to serve me so, I would con∣ur a devil out of him.

See.
Alas he is my child.




Dough.
No, you are his child to live in fear of him, indeed they say old men become children again, but before I would become my childes child, and make my foot my head, I would stand upon my head, and kick my heels at the sides.

Enter Gregory.
See.
You do not know what an only son is, O see, he comes now if you can appease his anger toward me, you shall doe an act of timely charity.

Dou.
It is an office that I am but weakly versed in,
To plead to a son in the fathers behalf,
Bless me what looks the devilish young Rascal
Frights the poor man withal!
Greg.
I wonder at your confidence, and how you dare ap∣pear before me.

Doug.
A brave beginning.

See.
O son be patient.

Greg.
It is right reverend council, I thank you for it, I shall study patience shall I, while you practice ways to beggar me, shall I?

Dough.
Very handsome.

See.
If ever I trangresse in the like again—

Greg.
I have taken your word too often sir and neither can nor will forbear you longer.

Dough.
What not your Father Mr. Gregory?

Greg.
Whats that to you sir?

Dough.
Pray tell me then sir, how many years has he to serve you.

Gre.
What do you bring your spokesman now, your advocate,
What fee goes out of my estate now, for his Oratory?
Dou.
Come I must tell you, you forget your self,
And in this foul unnatural strife wherein
You trample on your father. You are fallen
Below humanity. You're so beneath
The title of a son, you cannot claim
To be a man, and let me tell you were you mine
Thou should not eat but on thy knees before me.
See.
O this is not the way.
This is to raise Impatience into fury.


I do not seek his quiet for my ease,
I can bear all his chidings and his threats,
And take them well, very exceeding well,
And find they do me good on my own part,
Indeed they do reclaim me from those errors
That might impeach his fortunes, but I fear
Thunquiet strife within him hurts himself,
And wastes or weakens Nature, by the breach
Of moderate sleep and diet; and I can
No less than grieve to find my weaknesses
To be the cause of his affliction,
And see the danger of his health and being.
Dou.
Alas poor man? Can you stand open eyed
Or dry eyed either at this now in a Father?
Greg.
Why, if it grieve you, you may look of ont,
I have seen more than this twice twenty times,
And have as often •…in deceived by his dissimulations
I can see nothing mended.
Dou.
He is a happy •…re that has brought up his son to this.

See.
All shall be mended son content your self,
But this time forget but this last fault.
Greg.
Yes, for a new one to morrow.

Dou.
Pray Mr. Gregory forget it, you see how
Submissive your poor penitent is, forget it,
Forget it, put it out o'your head, knock it
Out of your brains. I protest, if my Father,
Nay if my fathers dog should have said
As much to me, I should have embraced him.
What was the trespass? It c'ud not be so heinous.
Greg.
Well Sir, you now shall be a Judge for all your jeering.
Was it a fatherly part think you having a son
To offer to enter in bonds for his nephew, so to endanger
My estate to redeem his mortgage.
See.
But I did it not son?

Gre.
I know it very well, but your dotage had done it,
If my careh•…d not prevented it.
Dou.
Is that the business: why if he had done it, had he not



bin sufficiently secured in having the mortgage made over to himself.
Greg.
He does nothing but practice ways to undo himself, and me: a very spendthrift, a prodigal sire, he was at the Ale but tother day, and spent a foure-penny club.

See.
It is gone and past son.

Greg.
Can you hold your peace sir? And not long ag•… at the
Wine he spent his tester, and two pence to the piper,
That was brave was it not?
See.
Truly we were civilly merry. But I have left it.

Greg.
Your civility have you not? For no longer ago than last holiday evening he gamed away eight double ringed tokens on a rubbers at bowls with the Curate, and some of his idle companions.

Dou.
Fie Mr. Gregory Seely is this seemly in a son.
You'll have a rod for the child your father shortly I fear.
Alas did he make it cry? Give me a stroke and Isle beat him,
Bless me, they make me almost as mad as themselves.
Greg.
'Tw•…re good you would meddle with your own mat∣ters •…ir.

See.
Son, son.

Greg.
Sir, Sir, as I am not beholden to you for house or Land, for it has stood in the name of my ancestry the Seelyes above two hundred years, so will I look you leave all as you found it.

Enter Lawrence.
Law.
What is the matter con yeow tell?

Greg.
O Lawrence, welcome, Thou wilt make al well I am sure.

Law.
Yie whick way con yeow tell, but what the foul evil done ye, here is sick an a din.

Dou.
Art thou his man fellow ha? that talk thus to him?

Law.
Yie sir, and what ma' yoew o'that, he maintains me to rule him, and i'll deu't, or ma'the heart weary of the weambe on him.

Dou.
This is quite upside down, the son controls the fa∣there, and the man overcrowes his masters coxscombe, sure they are all bewitched.

Greg.
It was but so, truly Lawrence; the peevish old man vex't me, for which I did my duty, in telling him his own, and



Doughty here maintains him against me.
Law.
I forbodden yeow to meddle with the old carl, and let me alone with him, yet yeow still be at him, he served yeow but weell to bast ye for it, ant he were stronk enough, but an I few foul with ye an I swaddle ye not savorly may my girts burst.

See.
Prithee good Lawrence be gentle and do not fright thy Master so.

Law.
Yie, at your command anon.

Dough.
Enough good Lawrence, you have said enough.

Law.
How trow yeou that? A fine World when a man can∣not be whyet at home for busy brained neighpors.

Dou.
I know not what to say to any thing here,
This cannot be but witchcraft.
Enter Join and Winnie.
Win.
I cannot endure it nor I will not endure it.

Dou.
Hey day! the daughter upon the mother too.

Win.
One of us two, choose you which, must leave the house, wee are not to live together I see that, but I will know, if there be Law in Lancashire for it, which is fit first to depart the house or the World, the mother or the daughter.

Join.
Daughter I say.

Win.
Do you say the daughter, for that word I say the mother, unless you can prove me the eldest, as my discretion almost war∣rant it, I say the mother shall out of the house or take such cour∣ses in it as shall sort with such a house and such a daughter.

Joan.
Daughter I say, I will take any course so thou wilt leave thy piston; indeed it hurts thee child, I'll sing and be merry, wear as fine clothes, and as delicate dressings as thou wilt have me, so thou wilt pacify thy self, and be at peace with me.

Win.
O will yo•… so, in so doing I may chance to look upon you. Is this a fit habit for a handsome young Gentlewo∣mans mother, as I hope to be a Lady, you look like one of the Scottish wayward sisters, O my hart has got the hickup, and all


look 〈◊〉 greene about 〈◊〉; a merry song now mother, and thou shalt be my white girl.
Join.
Ha, ha, ha! she's overcome with joy at my conversion.

Dough.
She is most evidently bewitched.

Joane.

Song.
There was a deft Lad and a Lass fell in love,
with a fa la la, fa la la, Langtidowne dilly;
With kissing and toying this Ma•…den did prove,
with a fa la la, fa la la, Langtidowne dilly;
So wide •…' th wast, and her Belly so high,
That unto her mother the Maiden did cry,
O Langtidowne dilly, O Langtidowne dilly,
fa la la Langtidowne, Lang•…idowne dilly.
Enter Parnell.
Porn.
Thus wooden yeou done and I were dead, but while I live yoeu fadge not on it, is this awe the work yeou con •…in?

Dough.
Now comes the Maid to set her Mis•…sses to work.

Win.

ACTVS, II. SCENE, I.
Enter 4. VVitches: (severally.)
All.
HOe! well met, well met.
Meg. What new devise, what dainty strain
More for our mirth now then our gain,
Shall we in practice put.
Meg.
Nay dame,
Before we play another game.
We must a little laugh and thank
Our feat familiars for the prank
They played us last.
Mewed.
Or they will miss
Vs in our next plot, if for this
They find not their reward.
Meg.
It is right.

Gel.
Therefore sing Mewed, and call each spright.
Come away, and take thy duggy,
Enter four Spirits.
Meg.
Come my Mamilion like a Puggy,

Mewed.
And come my puckling take thy teat,
Your travels have deserved your meat.
Meg.
Now upon the Churls ground
On which we're met, lets dance a round;
That Cocle, Darnel, Poppy wild,
May choke his grain, and fill the field.
Gel.
Now spirits fly about the task,
That we projected in our Mask.
Exit Spirits.
Meg.
Now let us laugh to think upon
The feat which we have so lately done,
In the distraction we have set
In Seelyes house; which shall beget
Wonder and sorrow amongst our foe•…s,

Whilst we make laughter of their woes.
All.
Ha, ha, ha!

Meg.
I can but laugh now to foresee,
The fruits of their perplexity.
Gel.
Of …eely's family?

Meg.
I, I, I, the Father to the Son doth cry,
The Son rebukes the Father old;
The Daughter at the mother Scold,
The wife the husband check and chide,
But that's no wonder, through the wide
World it is common.
Gel.
But to be short,
The wedding must bring on the sport
Betwixt the hare-brayn'd man and maid,
Master and dame that over-sway'd.
All.
Ha, ha, ha!

Meg.
Enough, enough,
Our sides are charmed, or else this stuff
Would laughter-cracke them; let's away
About the Jig. we dance to day,
To spoil the Hunters sport.
Gel.
I that, be now the subject of our chat.

Meg.
Then list ye well, the Hunters are
This day by vow to kill a Hare,
Or else the sport they will forswear;
And hang their Dogs up.
Mewed.
Stay, but where
Must the long threatened hare be found?
Gill.
They'll search in yonder Meadow ground.

Meg.
There will Ibe, and like a wily What,
Until they put me up; isle squat.
Gill.
I and my puckling will a brace
Of Greyhounds be, fit for the race;
And linger where we may be tan
Up for the course in the by-lane;
Then will we lead their Dogs a course,
And every man and every horse;
Until they break their necks, and say—



All.
The Devil on Dun is rid this way. Ha. ha, ha, ha.

Meg.
All the doubt can be but this,
That if by chance of me they miss,
And start another Hare.
Gel.
Then we'll not run
But find some way how to be gone.
I shall know thee Peg, by thy grissel'd gut,
Meg.
And I you Gilian by your gaunt thin gut.
But where will Mewed bestow her self today?
Mewed.
Of the Steeple top; Isle sit & see you play.

Exeuunt.
Enter Mr. Generous, Arthur, Ba•…tam, Shakstone, and Whetstone.
Goner.
At meeting, and at parting Gentlemen,
I only make use of that general word,
So frequent at all feasts, and that but once; you're welcome.
You are so, all of you, and I entreat you
Take notice of that special business,
Betwixt this Gentleman my friend, and I.
About the Mortgage, to which writings drawn,
Your hands are witness.
Boxed. & Shake.
We acknowledge it.

VVhet.
My hand is there too, for a man cannot set to his Mark, but it may be called his hand; I am a Gentleman both ways, and it hath been held that it is the part of a Gentleman, to write a scurvy hand.

Bant.
You write Sir like your self.

Goner.
Pray take no notice of his ignorance,
You know what I foretold you.
Arth.
It is confessed, but for that word by you so seldom spoke
By us so freely on your part performed,
We hold us much engaged.
Goner.
I pray, no complement,
It is a thing I doe not use my self,
Nor doe I love 't in others.
Art•….
For my part, could I at once dissolve my self to words
And after turn them into matter; such


And of that strength, as to attract the attention
Of all the curious, and most itching ears
Of this our Critic age; it could not make
A theme amounting to your noble worth:
You seem to me to super-arrogate,
Supplying the defects of all your kindred
To innob le your own name: I now have done Sir.
VVhet.
Hey day, this Gentleman speaks likes a Country
Parson that had took his text out of Ovids Metamorphosis.
Goner.
Sir, you Hyperbolize;
And I cooed chide you for it, but whilst you connive
At this my Kinsman, I shall wink at you;
'Twil prove an equal match.
Goner.
Your name proclaims
To be such as it speaks, you, Generous.
Goner.
Still in that strain!

Arth.
Sir, sir, whilst you persevere to be good
I must contiuue grateful.
Goner.
Gentlemen, the gr•…attest part of this day you see is spent
In reading deeds, conveyances, and bonds,
With sealing and subscribing; will you now
Take part of a bad Supper.
Arth.
We are like travellers
And where such bait, they doe not use to Inn.
Our love and service to you.
Goner.
The first I accept,
The Last I entertain not, farewell Gentlemen.
Arth.
VVe'l try if we can find in our way home
When Hares come from their coverts, to reliffe,
A course or too.
VVhet.
Say you so Gentlemen, nay then I am for your comp∣ny still, it is said Hares are like Hermophrodites, one while Male, and another Female, and that which begets this year, brings young ones the next; which some think to be the reason that witches take their shapes so oft: Nay if I lye Pliny lies too, but come, now I have light upon you, I cannot so lightly leave you farewell Uncle.




Goner.
Cozen I wish you would consort your self,
With such men ever, and make them your President,
For a more Gentile carriage.
Arth.
Good Master Generous—

Exeunt, manet Ge∣nerous.
Enter Robert.
Gen.
Robin.

Rob.
Sir.

Gen.
Go call your Mistress hither.

Rob.
My Mistress Sir, I doe call her Mistress, as I do•… call you Master, but if you would have me call my Mistress to my Master, I may call loud enough before she can hear me.

Goner.
Why she's not deaf I hope, I am sure since Dinn•…r
She had her hearing perfect.
Rob.
And so she may have at Supper too for ought I know, but I can assure you she is not now within my call.

Goner.
Sirrah you trifle, give me the Key of the Stable,
I will go see my Gelding; in the mean time
Go seek her out, say she shall find me there.
Rob.
To tell you true sir, I shall neither find my Mistress here, nor you your Gelding there.

Goner.
Ha! how comes that to posse?

Rob.
Whilst you were busy about your writings, she came and commanded me to saddle your Beast, and said she would ride abroad to take the ayre.

Goner.
Which of your fellows did she take along to wait on her?

Rob.
None sir.

Goner.
None! hath she used it often?

Rob.
Oftner I am sure then she goes to Church, and leave out Wednesdays and Fridays.

Goner.
And still alone?

Rob.
If you call that alone, when no body rides in her company.

Gen.
But what times hath she sorted for these journeys?

Rob.
Commonly when you are abroad, and sometimes when you are full of business at home.

Goner.
To ride out often and alone, what saith she
When she takes horse, and at her back return?
Rob.
Only conjures me that I shall keep it from you, then clappes me in the fist with some small piece of silver, and then a



Fish cannot be more silent then I.
Gen.
I know her a good woman and well bred,
Of an unquestioned carriage, well reputed
Amongst her neighbours, reckoned with the best
And ore me most indulgent; though in many
Such things might breed a doubt and jealousy,
Yet I hatch no such frenzy. Yet to prevent
The smallest jar that might betwixt us happen;
Give her no notice that I know thus much.
Besides I charge thee, when she craves him next
He be denied: if she be vexed or moved
Doe not thou fear, Isle interpose my self
Betwixt thee and her anger, as you tender
Your duty and my service, see this done.
Rob.
Now you have expressed your mind, I know what I have to doe; first, not to tell her what I have told you &, next to keep her side-saddle from coming upon your Gueldings back; but how soever it is like to hinder me of many a round tester.

Goner.
As oft as thou deny her, so oft claim
That tester from me, 't shall be roundly paid.
Rob.
You say well in that sir, I dare take your word, you are an honest Gentleman, and my Master; and now •…ache mine as I am your true servant, before she shall back your Guelding a∣gain in your absence, while I have the charge of his keeping; she shall ride me, or Isle ri•…e her.

Gen.
So much for that. Sirrah my Butler tells me
My Seller is drunk dry, I mean those Bottles
Of Sack and Claret, are all empty grown
And I have guests to morrow, my choice friends.
Take the gray Nag in the stable, and those Bottles
Fill at Lancaster,
There where you use to fetch it.
Rob.
Good news for me, I shall sir.

Gen.
O Robin, it comes short of that pure liquor
We drunk last Term in London at the Mitre
In Fleet-street, thou remember it; me thought
It was the very spirit of the Grape,



Mere quintessence of Wine.
Rob.
Yes sir, I so remember it, that most certain it is I no∣ver shall forget it, my mouth waters ever since when I but think on it, whilst you w•…re at supper above, the drawer had me down into the Cellar below, I know the way in again if I see it, but at that time to find the way out again, I had the help of more eyes than mine own: is the taste of that Ipsitate s•…il in your pal∣lat sir?

Goner.
What then? But vain are wishes, take those bottles
And see them filled where I command you sir.
Rob.
I shall: never c'ud I have met with such a fair oppor∣tunitie: for just in the mid way lies my sweet-heart, as lovely a lass as any is in Lancashire, and kisses as sweetly 〈◊〉 see her go∣ing or coming, i'll have one smouch at thy lips, and bee with thee to bring Mal Spencer.

Exit.
Gen.
Go hasten your return, what he hath told me
Touching my wife is somewhat strange, no matter
Be it as it will, it shall not trouble me.
She hath not lain so long so near my side,
That now I should be jealous.
Enter a soldier.
Sold.
You seem sir a Gentleman of quality, and no doubt but in your youth have been acquainted with affairs military, in your very looks there appears bounty, and in your person hue∣manity. Please you to vouchsafe the tender of some small cour∣tesie to help to bear a soldier into his country.

Gen.
Though I could tax you friend, & justly too
For begging against the Statute in that name,
Yet I have ever bin of that compassion,
Where I see want, rather to pity it
Than to use power. Where hast thou served?
Sold.
With the Russian against the Polack, a heavy war, and hath brought me to this hard fate. I was took prisoner by the Pole, & after some few weeks of durance, got both my freedom and posse. I have it about me to show, please you to vou•…as the perusal.



Goner.
It shall not need. What Countryman.

Sold.
Yorkshire sir. Many a sharp battle by land, and ma∣ny a sharpe storm at sea, many a long mile, and many a short meal, I have travelled and suffered ere I c'ud reach thus far, I 〈◊〉 you sir take my poor & wretched case into your worcester∣ships noble consideration.

Goner.
Perhaps thou love this wandering life
To be an idle loitering beggar, than
To eat of thine own labour.
Sold.
I sir! Loitering I defy sir, I hate laziness as I do lepro∣sie: It is the next way to breed the scurvy, put me to hedge, ditch, plow, thresh, dig, delve, any thing: your worship shall find that •… love nothing less than •…oitering.

Goner.
Friend thou speak well.

Enter Miller (his •…ands and face scratched, and bloody.
Miller.
Your Mill quoth he, if ever you take me in your mill again, i'll give you leave to cast my flesh to the dogs, and grind my flesh to powder, betwixt the Milstones. Cats do you call them, for their hugeness they might bee cat a mountains, and for their claws, I think I have it here in red and white to sh•…w, •… pray look here sir, a murrain take them, isle be sworn they have 〈◊〉, where I am •…ur it itched not.

Goner.
How came thou in this pickle?

Ml.
Yoiu see sir, and what you see, I have felt, & am come to give you to unde•…stand i'll not endure such another night if you would give me your mill for nothing, they say we Millers are thieves: but I c'ud as soon bee hanged as steal one piece of a •…ap all the night long, good Landlord provide your self of a new tenant, the noise of such caterwauling, & such scratching and clawing, before I would endure again, i'll bee tied to the •…ail when the wind blows sharpest, and they fly swiftest, till I be torn into as many fitters as I have toes and fingers.

Sold.
I was a Miller my self before I was a soldier. What one of my own trade should be so poorly spirited frighted with cats?

Sir trust me with the Mill that he forsakes.
H•…re is a blade that hangs upon this belt
〈◊〉 spite of all these Rats, Cats, Weasels, Witches



Or Dogs, or Devils, Shall so conjure them
I'll quiet my possession.
Goner.
Well spoke Soldier.
I like thy resolution▪ Fellow, you then
Have given the Mill quite over.
Mil.
Over and over, here I utterly renounce it; nor would I stay in it longer, if you would give me your whole estate; nay if I say it, you may take my word Landlord.

Sold.
I pray sir dare you trust your mill with me.

Goner.
I dare, but I am loath, my reasons these.
For many •…oneths, scarce any one hath lien there
But have bin strangely frighted in his sleep,
Or from his warm bed drawn into the floor,
Or clawd and scratched, as thou see this poor man,
So much, that it stood long untenanted,
Till he late undertook it, now thine eyes
Witness how he hath sped.
Sold.
Give me the keys, isle stand it all danger.

Goner.
It is a match: deliver them.

Mil.
Mary withal my heart, and I am glad, I am so rid of em.

Exeunt.
Enter Boy with a switch.
Boy.
Now I have gathered Bullies, and filled my belly pretty well, i'll go see some sport. There are gentlemen coursing in the meadow hard by; and it is a game that I love better than go∣ing to School ten to one.

Enter an invisible spirit. I. Adson with a brace of grey∣hounds.
What have we here a brace of Greyhounds broke loose from their masters: it must needs be so, for they have both their Col∣lers and slips about their necks. Now I look better upon them, me thinks I should know them, and so I do: these are Mr. Robinsons dogs, that dwells some two miles off, i'll take them up, & lead them home to their master; it may be something in my way, for he is as liberal a gentleman, as any is in our country, Come Hector, come. Now if I c'ud but start a Hare by the way, •…ill her, and carry her home to my supper, I should think •… had



made a better afternooones work of it than gathering of bu•…∣lies. Come poor cures along with me.
Exit.
Enter Arthur, Bantam, Shakstone, and Whestone.
Arth.

Shake.

Arth.
A piece.

Yes when he's at his lap •…whole take his part.

Arth.
Bantam forbear him prithee.

Bant.
He talks so like an Ass I have not patience to endure his non sense.

Whet.

Bant.
Of what?

Whet.
Of what you dare; name them from the last
〈◊〉 with the double rings, to the late
Coy'nd 〈◊〉 which they say are all counterfeit.
Bant.
Well sir, I take 〈◊〉: will •…ou cover these, give them in∣to the hands of either of those two gentlemen.

Whet.
What needs that? doe you think my word and my money is not all one?

Bant.
And weigh alike: both many grains too light.

〈◊〉▪
Enough of that, I presume Mr. Whetstone, you are not 〈◊〉 what belongs to the sport of hunting.

Whet.
I think I have reason, for I have bin at the death of more 〈◊〉.

Bant.
More then you shed the last fall of the leaf.

〈◊〉.
More then any man here I am sure. I should be loath at these years to be ignorant of hairing or whoring. I kn•…w a hare close hunred, clime a tree.

Bant.
To find out birds 〈◊〉

Whet.
Another 〈◊〉 into a river, nothing appearing above water, save only the tip of her nose to take breath.

〈◊〉
Nay that's very likely, for no man can fish with an 〈◊〉 but his Line must be made of hare.

W•…et.
You say right, I kn•…w another, who to escape the
Dogs hath taken a house, and leapt in at a window.


Bant.
It is thought you came into the World that way.

Whet.
How mean you that?

Bant.
Because you are a bastard.

Whet.
Bastard! O base.

Bant.
And thou art base all over.

Arth.
Needs must I now condemn your indiscretion,
To set your wit against his.
Whet.
Bastard? that shall be tried; well Gentlemen con∣corning Hare-hunting you might have hard more, if he had had the grace to have said less, but for the word Bastard, if I do not tell my Uncle, I and my Aunt too, either when I would speak ought or go of the s•…ore for any thing, let me never be trusted, they are older than I, and what know I, but they might bee by when I was begot; but if thou Bantam dost not hear of this with both thine ears, if thou hast them still, and not lost them by scribbling, instead of Whet-stone call me Grind•…-stone, and for Bible•…w, Bulfinch. Gentlemen, for two of you your company is fair and honest; but for you Bantam, remember and take no∣tice also, that I am a bastard, and so much i'll testify to my Aunt and Uncle.

Exit.
Arth.
What have you done, it will gre•…ve the good old Gen∣tleman, to hear him baffled thus.

Bant.
I was in a cold sweat ready to faint
The time he staid amongst us.
Shake.
But come, now the Hare is found and started▪
She shall have Law, so to our sport.
Exit.
Enter Boy with the Greyhounds.
A Hare, a Hare, hall•…e, halloe, the Devil take these cures, will they not stir, halloe, halloe, there, there, there, what are they grown so lither and so lazy?

As he beats them, there appears before him, Gooddy Dic∣kison, and the Boy upon the dogs, going in.
Now bless me heaven, one of the Greyhounds turned into a woman, the other into a boy! The lad I never saw before, but her I know well; it is my gimmal Dickison.

G. Dick.
Sirah, you have served me well to swindge me thus.
You young rogue, you have used me like a dog.
Boy.
When you had put your selfinto a dogs skin, I pray how c'ud I help it; but gimmal are not you a Witch? if you bee, I beg upon my knees you will not hurt me.

Decks.
Stand up my boy, for thou shalt have no harm,
Be silent, speak of nothing thou hast seen.
And here's a shilling for thee.
Boy.
Isle have none of your money gimmal, because you are a Witch: and now she is out of her four legged shape, isle see if with my two legs I can out-run her.

Decks.
Nay sir, though you be young, and I old, you are not so nimble, nor I so lame, but I can overtake you.

Boy.
But Gimmal what do you mean to do with me
Now you have me?
Decks.
To hug thee, stroke thee, and embrace thee thus,
And teach thee twenty thousand pretty things.
So thou tell no tales; and boy this night
Thou must along with me to a brave feast.
Boy.
Not I gimmal indeedla, I dare not stay ont late, My father is a fell man, and if I bee out long, will both chide and beat me.

Decks.
Not sir, then perforce thou shalt along,
This bridle helps me still at need,
And shall provide us of a steed.
Now sir, take your shape and be
Prepared to hurry him and me.
Now look and tell me wher's the lad become.
Exit.
Boy.
The boy is vanished, and I can see nothing in his stead

But a white horse ready saddled and bridled.
Decks.
And that's the horse we must bestride,
On which both tho•… and I must ride,
Thou boy before and I behind,
The earth we tread not, but the wind,
For we must progress through the air,
And I will bring thee to such fare
As thou ne'er saw, up and away,
For now no longer we can stay.

Mal.
He shall not chide thee, fear it not.

Robin.
Pray Bacchus I may please him with his wine, which will be the hardest thing to do; for since he was last at London and tasted the Divinity of the▪ Mitre, scarce any liquor in Lan∣cashier will go down with him, sure, sure he will never be a Pu∣ritane, he holds so well with the Mitre.

Mal.
Well Robert, I find your love by your haste from me, isle undertake you shall be at Lancaster, & twice as far, & yet at home time enough, and be ruled by me.

Rob.
Thou art a witty rogue, and think to make me believe any thing, because I saw thee make thy broom sweep the house without hands t'other day.

Mal.
You shall see more than that presently, because you shall believe me; you know the house is all a bed here: and I dare not be mist in the morning. Besides, I must be at the wed∣ding of Lawrence and Parnell to morrow.



Rob.

Mal.
I care not for the loss of him, but if I 〈◊〉 him not hang me: but to the point, if I go with you to night, and help you to as good wine as your master desires, and you keep your time with him, you will give me a pint for my company.

Rob.
Thy belly full wench.

Mal.
I'll but take up my milk pail and leave it in the field, till our coming back in the morning, and we'll away.

Rob.
Go fetch it quickly then.

Mal.
No Robert, rather than leave your company so long, it shall come to me.

Rob.
I would but see that.

The Pail goes.
Mal.
Look yonder, what do you think on it.

Rob.
Light, it comes; and I do think there is so much of the Devil in it as will turn all the milk shall come in it these seven years, and make it burn too, till it stink worse than the Pro∣verb of the Bishops foot.

Mal.
Look you sir, here I have it, will you get up and a∣way.

Rob.
My horse is gone, nay prithee Mal. thou hast set him a∣wa•…, leave thy Roguery.

Mal.
Look again.

Rob.
There stands a black long-sided jade: mine was a trussed gray.

Mal.
Yours was too short to carry double such a journey.
Get up I say, •…ou shall have your own again in the morning.
Rob.
Nay but, nay but.

Mal.
Nay, and you stand butting now, i'll leave you to look your horse. Pail on before to the field, and stay till I come.

Dought.
What shall we doe, dare we stay any longer?

Arth.
Dare we! why not, I defy all VVitches, and all their works; their power on our meat, cannot reach our persons.

Whet.
I say so too, and so my Aunt ever told me, so long I will fear nothing; be not afraid Mr. Doughty.

Dough.
Zookes, I fear nothing living that I can see more then you, and that's nothing at all, but to think of these invisi∣ble mischiefs, troubles me I confess.

Arth.
Sir I will not go about to over-rule your reason, but



but for my part I will not out of a house on a Bridal day, till I see the last man borne.
Dough.
Zookes thou art so brave a fellow that I will stick to thee, and if we come off handsomely, I am an old Bachelor thou know, and must have an heir, I like thy spirit, whore's the Bride? whore's the Bridegroom? whore's the Music? where be the Lasses? have you any wine in the house, though we make no dinner▪ lets try if we can make an afternoon.

Join.
Nay sir if you please to stay, now that the many are frighted away, I have some good cold meates, and half a dozen bottles of Wine.

Seel.
And I will bid you welcome.

Dough.
Say you me so, but will not your son be angry, and your daughter chide you.

Greg.
Fear not you that sir, for look you I obey my Father.

Win.
And I my Mother.

Join.
And we are all at this instant as well and as sensible of our former errors, as you can wish us to be.

Dough.
Na, if the Witches have but robbed of your meat, and restored your reason, here has been no hurt done to day, but this is strange, and as great a wonder as the rest to me.

Arth.
It seems though these Hags had power to make the Wedding cheer a Deceptio visus, the former store has escaped 'em.

Dough.
I am glad on it, but the devil good 'hem with my Sirloin, I thought to have set that by mine own Trencher—But you have cold meat you say?

Joan.
Yes Sir.

Dought.
And Wine you say?

Join.
Yes sir.

Dought.
I hope the Country wenches and the Fiddlers are not gone.

Win.
They are all here, and one the merriest Wench; that makes all the rest so laugh and tickle.

Seel.
Gentlemen will you in?

All.
Agreed on all parts.

Dought,
If not a Wedding we will make a Wake on it, and away with the Witch; I fear nothing now you have your wits again: but look you, hold 'em while you have 'em.

Exeunt.


Enter Generous, and Robin, with a Paper.
Goner.
I confess thou hast done a Wonder in fetching me so good Wine, but my good Servant Robert, go not about to put a Miracle upon me, I will rather believe that Laneaster affords this Wine, which I thought impossible till I tasted it, then that thou coo'dst in one night fetch it from London.

Rob.
I have known when you have held me for an honest fellow, and would have believed me.

Goner.
The art a Knave to wish me to believe this, forgi'me, I would have sworn if thou had stayed but time answerable for the journey (to his that flew to Paris and back to London in a day) it had been the same Wine, but it can never fall within the compass of a Christians belief, that thou could ride above three hundred miles in 8. hours: You were no longer out, and upon one Horse too, and in the Night too!

Rob.
And carry a Wench behind me too, and did something else too, but I must not speak of her lest I be divell-torne.

Gen.
And fill thy bottles too, and come home half drunk too, for so thou art, thou would never a had such a fancy else!

Rob.
I am sorry I have said so much, and not let Lancaster have the credit of the Wine.

Gen.
O are you so! and why have you abused me and your self then all this while, to glorify the Mitre in Fleet-street?

Rob.
I could say sir, that you might have the better opinion of the Wine, for there are a great many palates in the Kingdom that can relish no Wine, unless be of such a Tavern, and drawn by such a Drawer—

Gen.
I said, and I say again, if I were within ten mile of London, I durst swear that this was Mitre Wine, and drawn by honest Jack Pain.

Rob.
Nay then sir I swore, and I swear again•…, honest Jack Pain drew it.

Goner.
Ha, ha, ha, if I cooed believe there were such a thing as Witchcraft, I should think this slave were bewitched now with an opinion.

Rob.
Much good doe you sir, your Wine and your mirth, and my place for your next Groom, I desire not to stay to be laughed out of my opinion.

Gen.
Nay be not angry Robin, we must not part so, and how does my honest Drawer? ha, ha, ha; and what news at Lone∣don, Robin? ha, ha, ha; but your stay was so short I think you cooed hear none, and such your haste home that you cooed make none: is it not so Robin? ha, ha, ha, what a strange fancy has good Wine begot in his head?

Rob.
Now will I push him over and over with a piece of paper: Yes sir, I have brought you something from London.

Gen.
Come on, now let me hear.

Rob.
Your honest Drawer sir, considering that you consi∣der'd him well for his good wine—

Gen.
What shall we hear now?

Rob.
Was very careful to keep or convey this paper to you, which it seems you dropped in the room there.

Goner.
Bless me! this paper belongs to me indeed, it is an ac∣quittance, and all I have to show for the payment of one hun∣dred pound, I took great care for it, and cooed not imagine where or how I might loose it, but why may not this bee a trick? this Knave may find it when I lost it, and conceal it till now to come over me withal. I will not trouble my thoughts with it further at this time, well Robin look to your business, and have a care of my Guelding.

Exit Generous.
Robin.
Yes Sir. I think I have nettled him now, but not as I was nettled last night, three hundred Miles a Night upon a Rawboned Devil, as in my heart it was a Devil, and then a Wench that shared more of my back then the said Devil did of my Bum, this is rank riding my Masters: but why had I such an itch to tell my Master of it, and that he should believe it; I doe now wish that I had not told, and that he will not be∣leeve it, for I dare not tell him the means: 'Sfoot my Wench and her friends the Fiends, will tear me to pieces if I discover her; a notable rogue, she's at the VVedding now, for as good a Maid as the best o'em—O my Mistress.

Enter Mrs. Generous, with a Bridle.
Mrs.
Robin.

Rob.
I Mistress.

Mrs.
Quickly good Robin, the gray Guelding.

Rob.
What other horse you please Mistress.

Mrs.
And why not that?

Rob.
Truly Mistress pray pardon me, I must be plain with you, I dare not deliver him you; my master has tan notice of the ill case you have brought him home in divers times.

Mrs.
O is it so, and must he be made acquainted with my actions by you, and must I then be controlled by him, and now by you; you are a sawey Groom.

Rob.
You may say your pleasure.

He turns from her,
Mrs.
No sir, Isle doe my pleasure.

She Bridles him.
Rob.
Awe.

Mrs.
Horse, horse, see thou be,
And where I point thee carry me.
Exeunt Neighing.
Enter Arthur, Shakston, and Bantam.
Arth.
Was there ever such a medley of mirth, madness, and drunkenness, shuffled together.

Shake.
Thy Uncle and Aunt, old Mr. Seely and his wife, doe nothing but kiss and play together like Monkeys.

Arth.
Yes, they doe over-love one another now.

Bant.
And young Gregory and his sister doe as much over∣doe their obedience now to their Parents.

Arth.
And their Parents as much over-doat upon them, they are all as far beyond their wits now in loving one another, as they were wide of them before in crossing.

Shake.
Yet this is the better madness.

Bant.
But the married couple that are both so daintily whit∣led, that now they are both mad to be a bed before Supper∣time, and by and by he will, and she wo' not; straight she will and he wo' not, the next minute they both forget they are mar∣ried, and defy one another.

Arth.
My sides even ache with laughter.

Shake.
But the best sport of all is, the old Bachelor Master


Doughty, that was so cautious, & feat'd every thing to be witeh∣craft, is now wound up to such a confidence that there is no such thing, that he dares the Devil doth his worst, and will not out of the house by all persuasion, and all for the love of the husband∣mans daughter within, Mal Spencer.
Arth.
There I am in some danger, he put me into half a be∣lief I shall be his heir, pray love she be not a witch to charm his love from me. Of what condition is that wench dost thou know her?

Sha.
A little, but Whetstone knows her better.

Arth.
Hang him rogue, he will belie her, and speak better than she deserves, for he's is love with her too. I saw old Doughty give him a box of the ear for kissing her, and he turned about as he did by thee yesterday, and swore his Aunt should know it.

Bant.
Who would ha'thought that impudent rogue•… would have come among us after such a baffle.

Sha.
He told me, he had complained to his Aunt on us, and that she would speak with us.

Arth.
Wee will all to her to patch up the business, for the respect I bear her husband, noble Generous.

Bant.
Here he comes.

Enter Whetstone.
Arth.
Hark you Mr. Byblow do you know the lass within?
What do you call her, Mal Spencer?
Whet.
Sir, what I know i'll keep to my self, a good c•…vile merry harmless to•…e she is, and comes to my Aunt often, and that's all I know by her.

Arth.
You doe well to keep it to your self sir.

Whet.
And you may do well to question her if you dare. For the testy old coxcomb that will not let her go out of his hand.

Sha.
Take heed, he's at your heels.

Enter Doughty, Ma•…, two country Lasses

— Yet me thought a fly touched it. Did you see any thing?
Dou.
No, no, yet I would almost ha'sworn, I would not have sprite or goblin blast thy face, for all their kingdom. But hangt there is no such thing: Fiddlers will you play?

Selengers Round.
Gentlemen will you dance?

All.

Arth.
But stay wheres this household?

Sha.
Here they come all
In a True-love knot.
Enter Seely, Join, Greg, Win.
Greg.
O Father twenty times a day is too little to ask you blessing.

See.
Go too you are a rascal: and you housewife teach your daughter better manners: i'll ship you all for new England else.

Bant.
The knot's untied, and this is another change.

Join.
Yes I will teach her manners, or put her out to spin two penny tow: so you dear husband will but take me into favour: i'll talk with you dame when the strangers are gone.

Greg.
Dear Father.

Win.
Dear Mother.

Greg. Win.
Dear Father and Mother pardon us but this time.

See. Ioa.
Never, and therefore hold your peace.

Dough.
Nay that's unreasonable.

Greg. Win.
Oh!—

Weep.
See.
But for your sake i'll forbear them, and bear with any thing this day.

Arth.
Doe you note this? Now they are all worse then e∣ver they were, in a contrary vain: What think you of Witch∣craft now?

Dou.
They are all natural fools man, I find it now.

Art thou mad to dream of Witchcraft?

Arth.
He's as much changed and bewitched as they I fear.


Dough.
Hey day! Here comes the pair of boiled Lovers in Sorrel •ops.

Enter Lawrence and Parnell.
Lower.
Nay dear honey, nay honey, but eance, eance.

Par.

Music. Selengers round.
As they begin to dance, they play another tune, then fall into many.
Are. Ban. Sha.
Whether now, hoe?

Dou.
Hey day! why you rogues.

VVhet.

Dou.

Music. Every one a several tune.
Arth. Bant. Shake
Ha, ha, ha, How's this?

Bant.
Every one a several tune

Dou.
This is something towards it. I bad them play the be∣ginning of the World, and they play, I know not what.

Arth.
No it is running of the country several ways.

But what do you think on it.

Music cease.
Dough
Think! I think they are drunk Prithee doe not thou think of Witchcraft; for my part, I shall as soon think this maid one, as that theres any in Lancashire.

Mal.
Ha, ha ha.

Dough.
Why dost thou laugh?

Mal.
To think this Bridegroom should once ha'bin mine, but he shall rue it, isle hold him this point on it, and that's all I care for him.

Dough.
A witty Rogue.

Whet.
I tell you sir, they say she made a pail follow her t'other day up two pair of stayres.

Dough.

Arth.
O sir forget your anger.



Mal.

Mal.
Yes put it in your pocket it may stand you instead a∣non, when all your points be tan away, to truss up your trin∣kits, I mean your slopes withal.

Lower.
Mal for old acquaintance I will ma'thy point a point of preferment. It shan bee the Foreman of a haell Iewrie o'points, and right here will I wear it.

Par.
Wy'a, wy'a, old love wo no be forgotten, but ay's no∣ver be jealous the mare for that.

Arth.

Sha.
Play out that we may hear you.

Fid.
So we do sir, as loud as we can possibly.

Dough.
Doe you hear any thing?

All.
Nothing not we sir.

Dough.
It is so, the rogues are bribed to cross me,
And their Fiddles shall suffer, I will break em as small as the
Bride cake was to day.
Arth.
Look you sir, they'll save you a labour, they are doing it themselves.

Whet.
Oh brave Fiddlers, there was never better scuffling for the Tudberry Bu

Mal.
This is mother Iohnson and Gooddy Dickisons rogue∣rye, I find it but I cannot help it, yet I will have music: sir theres a Piper without, would be glad to earn money.

VVhet.
She has spoke to purpose, & whether this were witch∣craft or not: I have heard my Aunt say twenty times, that no Witchcraft can take hold of a Lancashire Bag-pipe, for it self is able to charm the Devil, isle fetch him.

Dough.
Well said, a good boy nów; come bride and bride∣groom, leave your kissing and fooling, and prepare to come in∣to the dance. We'll have a Horne-pipe, and then a posit and

All.
Bravely performed.

Dou.
Stay, wheres my lass?

Vanished, she and the Piper both vanished, no body knows how.

Dou.

ACTVS, IIII. SCENE, I.
Enter Mistress Generous and Robin.
KNow you this jingling bridle, if you see it again? I wanted but a pair of jingling spurs to make you mend your pace, and put you into a sweat.

Robin.
Yes, I have reason to know it after my



hard journey, they say there be light women, but for your own part, though you be merry. Yet I may be sorry for your heavi∣ness.
Mrs. Goner.
I see thou art not quite tired by shaking of thy self, it is a sign that as thou hast brought me hither, so thou art able to bear me back, and so you are like good Robert. You will not let me have your masters gelding, you will not. Well fir, as you like this journey, so deny him to me hereafter.

Rob.
You say well mistress, you have jaded me (a pox take you for a jade.) Now I bethink my self how damnably did I ride last night, and how devilishly have I bin rid now.

Mrs.
Doe you grumble you groom? Now the bridl's of, I turn thee to grazing gramercy my good horse, I have no bet∣la provender for thee at this time, thou had best like Aesops Ass to feed upon Thistles, of which this place will afford thee plenty. I am bid to a better banquet, which done, isle take thee up from grass, spur butt, and take a short cut home. Farewell.

Robin.
A pox upon your tail.

Enter all the Witches and Mal, at seve∣rall doors.
All.
The Lady of the feast is come, welcome, welcome.

Mrs.

The other we must pull for. But whats he?
Mrs.
My horse, my horse, ha, ha, ha.

All.
Ha, ha, ha.

Exeunt
Rob.
My horse, my horse, I would I were now some country Major, and in authority, to see if I would not venture to rowze your Satanicall sisterhood: Horse, horse, see thou be, & where  point thee, carry me: is that the trick on it? the devil himself shall be her carrier next if I can shun her: & yet my Mr. will not be∣leeve theres any witches: theres no running away; for I neither know how nor whether, besides to my thinking, theres a deep ditch, & a hie quick-set about me, how shall I posse the time? What place is this? it looks like an old barn: isle peep in at some cranny or other, and try if I can see what they are doing. Such a bevy of beldams did I never behold; and 



like so many Cormorants: Marry choke you with a mis∣chief.
Gooddy Dickison.
Whoop, whurre, here is a stir, never a cat, never a cur, but that we must have this demur.

Mal.
A second course.

Pull, and pull hard
For all that hath lately bin prepared
For the great wedding feast.

It is come, it is come.

Mewed.
Where hath it all this while been?

Meg
Some
Delay hath kept it, now it is here,
For bottles next of wine and beer,
The Merchants cellars they shall pay foe•…'t.
Mrs. Goner.
Well,
What sod or roast meat more, pray tell.
Good. Dick
Pull for the Poultry, Foul, & Fish,
For empty shall not be a dish.
Robin.
A pox take them, must only they feed upon hot meat, and I upon nothing but cold salads

Mrs. Goner.
This meat is tedious, now some Farie,
Fetch what belongs unto the Dairy.
Mal.
That's Butter, Milk, Whey, Curds and Cheese,
Wee nothing by the bargain leese.
All.
Ha, ha, ha.

Goody Dickison.
Boy, theres meat for you.

Boy.
Thank you.

Gooddy Decks
And drink too.

Meg.
What Beast was by thee hither rid?

Mewed.
A Badger nab.

Meg.
And I bestride
A Porcupine that never pricked.
Mal.
The dull sides of a Bear I kicked.
I know how you rid Lady Nan,
Mrs. Gen,
Ha, ha, ha, upon the knave my man.



Rob.
A murrain take you, I am sure my hooves paid for it.

Boy.
Meat lie there, for thou hast no taste, and drink there, for thou hast no relish, for in neither of them is there either salt or savour.

All.
Pull for the posit, pull.

Robin.
The brides posit on my life, nay if they come to their spoon meat once, I hope theil break up their feast presently.

Mrs. Gen.
So those that are our waiters ne'er,
Take hence this Wedding cheer.
We will be lively all, and make this barn our hall.
Gooddy Dick.
You our Familiars, come.
In speech let all be dumb,
And to close up our Feast,
To welcome every gest
A merry round let's dance.
Meg.
Some Music then ith air
Whilst thus by pair and pair,
We nimbly foot it; strike.
Music.
Mal.
We are obeyed.

Sprite.
And we hells ministers shall lend our aid.

Dance and Song together. In the time of which the Boy speaks.
Boy.
Now whilst they are in their jollity, and do not mind me, isle steal away, and shift for my self, though I lose my life for it.

Exit.
Meg.
Enough, enough, now patt,
To see the brides vexed heart,
The bridegrooms too and all,
That vomit up their gall
For lack of the wedding chere.
Gooddy Dickison.
But stay, wheres the Boy, look out, if he e∣escape us, we are all betrayed.

Meg.
No following further, yonder horsemen come,
In vain is our pursuit, let's break up court.
Gooddy Dickison.
Where shall we next met?

Mewed.
At Mil•…▪



Meg.
But when?

Mrs.
At Night.

Meg.
To horse, to horse.

2.
VVhere's my Mamilian.

1.
And my Incubus.

Robin stands amazed at this.
3.
My Tiger to bestri'd.

Mal.
My Puggie.

Mrs. Gen.
My horse.

All.
Away, away,
The night we have Feasted, now comes on the day.
Mrs.
Come sirrah, stoop your head like a tame jade,
Whilst I put on your Bridle.
Rob.
I pray Mistress ride me as you would be rid.

Mrs.
That's at full speed,

Rob.
Nay then Isle try Conclusions.

Mare Mare, see thou be,
And where I point thee carry me.
A great noise within at their parting. Exeunt.
Enter Mr. Generous, making him ready.
Gen.
I see what Man is loath to entertain,
Offers it self to him most frequently,
And that which we most covet to embrace,
Doth seldom court us, and proves most averse;
For I, that never cooed conceive a thought
Of this my woman worthy a rebuke,
(As one that in her youth bore her so fairly
That she was taken for a seeming Saint)
To render me such just occasion,
That I should now distrust her in her age;
Distrust! I cannot, that would bring me in
The poor aspersion of fond jealousy;
Which even from our first meeting I abhorred.
The Gentile fashion sometimes we observe
To sunder beds; but most in these hot months
June, July August, so we did last night.
Now I (as ever tender of her health)
And therefore rising early as I use,
Entering her Chamber to bestow on her
A customed Visit; find the Pillow swelled,


Unbruised with any weight, the sheets unruffled,
The Curtains neither drawn, nor bed laid down;
Which shows, she slept not in my house to night.
Should there be any contract betwixt her
And this my Groom, to abuse my honest trust;
I should not take it well, but for all this
Yet cannot I be jealous. Robin•…
Enter Robin.
Gen.
Is my horse safe, lusty, and in good plight?
What, feeds he well?
Rob.
Yes sir, he's broad buttocked and full flanck'd, he doth not bate an ace of his flesh.

Gen.
When was he rid last?

Rob.
Not sir since you backed him.

Gen.
sirrah, take heed I find you not a Knave,
Have you not lent him to your Mistress late?
So late as this last Night?
Rob.
Who I sir, may I dye sir, if you find me in a lye sir.

Goner.
Then I shall find him where I left him last.

Robin.
No doubt Sir.

Goner.
Give me the Key of the Stable.

Robin.
There Sir.

Gen.
Sirrah, your Mistress was abroad all night,
Nor is she yet come home, if there I find him not,
I shall find thee, what to this present hour
I never did suspect; and I must tell thee
Will not be to thy profit.
Exit.
Rob.
Well sir, find what you can, him you shall find, and what you find else; it may before that, instead of Gramercy horse, you may say Gramercy Robin; you will believe there are no Witches! had I not been late bridled, I cooed have said more, but I hope she is tied to the rack that will confess some∣thing, and though not so much as I know, yet no more then I dare justify—

Enter Generous.
Have you found your Gelding sir?

Gen.
Yes, I have.




Rob.
I hope not spurred, nor put into a sweat, you may see by his plump belly and fleak legs he hath not bin sore travailed.

Goner.
You're asawcy Groom to receive horses
Into my Stable, and not ask me leave.
Is it for my profit to buy Hay and Oats
For every strangers jades?
Rob.
I hope sir you find none feeding there but your own, if there be any you suspect, they have nothing to champion, but the Bridle.

Goner.
Sirrah, whose jade is that tied to the Rack?

Rob.
The Mare you mean sir?

Goner.
Yes, that old Mare.

Rob.
Old doe you call her? You shall find the mark still in her mouth, when the Bridle is out of it? I can assure you it is your own Beast.

Gen.
A beast thou art to tell me so, hath the wine
Not yet left working? not the Mitre wine?
That made thee to believe VVitchera•…t?
Prithee persuade me,
To be a d unken Sot like to thy self;
And not to know mine own.
Rob.
Isle not persuade you to any thing, you will believe nothing but what you see, I say the Beast is your own, and you have most right to keep her, she hath cost you more the currying, then all the Combs in your Stable are worth. You have paid for her Provender this twenty years and upwards, and furnished her with all the 〈◊〉 that she hath worn, of my Knowledge, and because she hath been ridden hard the last Night, doe you renounce her now?

Goner.
Sirrah, I fear some stolen jade of your own
That you would have me keep.
Rob.
I am sure I •…and her no •…ade the l•…st time I rid her, she carried me the best part of a hundred Miles in less then a quar∣la of an hour.

Goner.
The devil she did!

Robin.
Yes so I say, •…ether the d•…ell or she did; ain't please you 〈◊〉 in and take off her 〈◊〉, and then tell me who hath more right to her, you or •….


Gen.
Well Robert, for this once Isle play the Groom,
And doe your office for you.
Exit.
Rob.
I pray doe Sir, but take heed lest when the Bridle is out of her mouth, she put it not into yours; if she doe, you are a gone man: if she but say once▪ Horse, horse, see thou be. Be you rid (if you please) for me.

Enter Mr. Generous and Mrs. Generous, he with a Bridle.
Gen.
My blood is turned to Ice, and my all vitals
Have ceased their working! dull stupidity
Surprises me at once, and hath arrested
That vigorous agitation; Which till now
Expressed a life within me: I me thinks
Am a mere Marble statue, and no man;
Vnweave my age O time, to my first thread;
Let me loose fifty years in ignorance spent:
That being made an infant once again,
I may begin to know, what? or where am I
To be thus lost in wonder.
Mrs. Gen.
Sir.

Gen.
Amazement still pursues me, how am I changed
Or brought ere I can understand my self,
Into this new World.
Rob.
You will believe no VVitches?

Gen.
This makes me believe all, I any thing;
And that my self am nothing: prithee Robin
Lay me to my 〈◊〉 open, what art thou,
Or this new transformed Creature?
Rob.
I am Robin, and this your wife, my Mrs.

Gen,
Tell me the Earth
Shall leave it's seat, and mount to kiss the Moon;
Or that the Moon enamoured of the Earth,
Shall leave her sphere, to stoop to us thus low.
What? what's this in my hand, that at an instant
Can from a four legged Creature, make a thing
So like a wife?
Rob.
A Bridle, •… •…ugling Bridle Sir.

Gen.
A Bridle, hence enchantment,



A Viper were more safe within my hand
Then this charmed Engine
Casts it a∣way. Robin takes it up.
Rob.
Take heed Sir what you do, if you cast it hence, and she catch it up, we that are here now, may be rid as far as the Indies within these few hours, Mistress down of your Mares bones, or your Mary-bones whether you please, and confess your self to be what you are; and that's in plain English a Witch, a grand notorious Witch.

Gen.
A Witch! my wife a Witch!

Rob.
So it appears by the story.

Goner.
The more I strive to unwind
My self from this Meander, I the more
Therein am intricated; prithee woman
Art thou a Witch?
Mrs.
It cannot be denied, I am such a cursed Creature.

Gen.
Keep aloof, and doe not come too near me, O my trust;
Have •… since first I understood my self,
Bin of my soul so chary, still to study
What best was for it's health, to renounce all
The works of that black Fiend with my best force
And hath that Serpent twined me so about,
That I must lye so often and so long
With a Devil in my bosom!
Mrs.
Pardon sir.

Gen.
Pardon! Can such a thing as that be hoped?
Lift up thine eyes (lost woman) to yo•… Hills;
It must be thence expected: look not down
Unto that horrid dwelling, which thou hast sought
At such dear rate to purchase, prithee tell me,
(For now I can believe) art thou a Witch?
Mrs.
I am.

Gen.
With that word I am thunderstrooke,
And know not what to answer, yet resolve me
Hast thou mad•… any contract with that Fiend
The Enemy of Mankind?
Mrs.
O I have.

Gen.
What? and how far?

Mrs.
I have promised him my soul.

Gen.
Ten thousand times better thy Body had


Bin promised to the Stake, I and mine too,
To have suffered with thee in a hedge of flames:
Then such a compact •…ver had bin made. Oh—
Rob.
What you•…e sir, show your self a man, though she ap∣pear'd so late a Beast; Mistress confess all, better here than in a worse place, out with it.

Gen.
Resolve me, how far doth that contract stretch?

Mrs.
What inter•…st in this Soul, my self cooed claim
I freely gave him, but his part that made it
I still reserve, not being mine to give.
Gen.
O cunning Devil, foolish woman know
Where he can claim but the least little part,
He will usurp the whole; th•… art a lost woman.
Mrs.
I hope not so.

Gen.
Why hast thou any hope?

Mrs.
Yes Sir I have.

Gen.
Make it appear to me.

Mrs.
I hope I never bargained for that fire,
Further then penitent tears have power to quench.
Gen.
I would see some of them.

Mrs.
You behold them now.
(If you look on me with charitable eyes)
Tinctured in blood, blood issuing from the heart,
Sir I am sorry; when I look towards Heaven
I beg a gracious Pardon; when on you
Me thinks your Native goodness should not be
Less pitiful than they: against both I have erred,
From both I beg atonement.
Goner.
May I presum't?

Mrs.
I kneel to both your Mercies.

Goner.
Know thou what a Witch is?

Mrs.
Alas, None better,
Or after mature recollection can be
More sad to think on it.
Gen.
Tell me, are those tears
As full of true hearted penitence,
As mine of sorrow, to behold what state


What desperate state you are fallen in.
Mrs.
Sir they are.

Gen.
Rise, and as I doe, so heaven pardon me;
We all offend, but from such falling off,
Defend us. Well, I doe remember wife,
When I first took thee, it was for good and bad;
O change thy bad to good, that I may keep thee,
As then we past our faiths, till Death us sever.
I will not aggravate thy grief too much,
By Needles iteration: Robin hereafter
Forget thou hast a tongue, if the least Syllable
Of what hath past be rumoured, you loose me;
But if I find you faithful, you gain me ever.
Rob.
A match sir, you shall find me as mute as if I had the
Bridle still in my mouth.
Gen.
O woman thou had need to weep thy self
Into a fountain, such a penitent spring
As may have power to quench invisible flames
In which my eyes shall aid•…; too little all,
If not too little, ell's forgiven, forgot;
Only thus much remember, thou had extermin'd
Thy self out of the blessed society
Of Saints and Angels, but on thy repentance
I take thee to my Bosom, once again,
My wife, sister, and daughter: saddle my Gelding,
Some business that may hold me for two days
Calls me aside.
Exeunt
Rob.
I shall Sir, well now my Mistress hath promised to give over her Witchery, I hope though I still continue her man, yet she will make me no more her journey-man; to prevent which the first thing I doe shall be to burn the Bridle, and then a∣way with the Witch.

Exit.
Enter Arthur and Doughty.
A•…th.
Sir you have done a right noble curtsy, which de∣serves a memory, as long as the name of friendship can bear mention.


Dough.
What I have done, I ha'done, if it be well, it is well, J doe not like the bouncing of good Offices, if the little care I have taken shall doe these poor people good, I have my end in it, and so my reward.

Enter Bantam.
Bant.
Now Gentlemen, you seem very serious.

Arth.
It is true we are so, but you are welcome to the know∣ledge of our affairs.

Bant.
How does thine Uncle and Aunt, Gregory and his si∣ster, the Families of Seelyes agree yet, can you tell?

Arth.
That is the business, the Seely household is divided now.

Bant.
How so I pray?

Arth.
You know, and cannot but with pity know
Their miserable condition, how
The good old couple were abused, and how
The young abut'd themselves; if we may say
That any of hem are their selves at all
Which sure we cannot, nor approve them fit
To be their own disposers, that would give
The governance of such a house and living
Into their Vassailes hands, to thrust them out on it
Without or Law or order, this considered
This Gentleman and my self have taken home
By fair entreaty, the old folks to his house,
The young to mine, until some wholesome order
By the judicious of the Common-wealth,
Shall for their persons and estate be taken.
Bant.
But what becomes of Lawrénce and his Parnell?
The lusty couple, what doe they now?
Dough.
alas poor folks, they are as far to seek of how they doe, or what they doe, or what they should doe, as any of the rest, they are all grown Idiots, and till some of these dam∣noble jades, with their devilish devises bee found out, tod s∣charm them, no remedy can be found, I mean to lay the Coun∣try for their Hagships, and if J can anticipate the purpose, of their grand Mr. Devil to confound'em before their lease be out, be sure isle do to




A shout within.
Cry.
A Skimington, a Skimmington, a Skimington.

Dough.
Whats the matter now, is Hell broke loose?

Enter Mr Shakstone.
Arth.
Tom Shakstone, how now, can tell the news?

Sha.
The news, ye hear it up in the air, do you not?

Within.
A Skimington, a Skimington, a Skimington.

Sha.
Hark ye, do you not hear it? theres a Skimington, to∣wards gentlemen.

Dou.
Ware Wedlock hoe.

Bant.
At whose suit I prithee is Don Skimington come to town.

Sha.
Isle tell you gentlemen, since you have taken home old Seely and his wife to your house, and you their son and daugh∣la to yours, the house-keepers Lawrence, and his late bride Parnell are fallen out by themselves.

Arth.
How prithee?

Sha.
The quarrel began they say upon the wedding night, and in the bride bed.

Bant.
For want of bedstaves?

Sha.
No but a better implement it seems the bridegroom was unprovided of, a homely tale to tell.

Dou.
Now out upon her she has a greedy worm in her, I have heard the fellow complained on, for an over mickle men a∣mong the maids.

Arth.
Is his haste to go to bed at afternoon come to this now?

Dough.
Witchery, witchery, more witchery still flat and plain witchery. Now do I think upon the codpeece point the young jade gave him at the wedding: she is a witch, and that was a charm, if there be any in the World.

Arth.
A ligatory point.

Bant.
Alas poor Lawrence.

Sha.
He's coming to make his moan to you about it, and she too, since you have taken their masters & mistresses to your care, you must do them right too.

Dough.
Marry but isle not undertake her at these years, if lusty Lawrence cannot do it.

Bant.
But has she beaten him?



Sha.
Grievously broke his head in I know not how many places: of which the hoydens have taken notice, and will have a Ski•…mington on horse-backe presently. Look ye, here comes both plaintiff and defendant.

Enter Lawrence and Parnell.
Dough
How now Lawrence, what has thy wedlock brought thee already to thy night-cap?

Lower.
Yie gadwat sir, I ware wadded but awe to seun.

Nay hold Parnel hold.

Porn.
Ware ever poor maiden betrayed as a•… ware unto a swagbellied Carl that cannot awe waw that cannot.

What says she?

Dou.
I know not, she catterwawles I think. Parnel be patient good Parnell, and a little modest too, it is not amiss, wee know not the relifh of every ear that hears vs, lets talk within our selves. Whats the defect? Whats the impediment? Lawrence has had a lusty name among the Batch•…llors.

Par.

Are. Ba. Sha.
Peace Parnell.

Par.

Dou.
Here is good stuff•… for a jury of women to posse upon.

Arth.
But Parnel, why have you beaten him so grievously?
What would you have him doe in this case?
Dou.
He's out of a doing case it seems.




Par.
Marry sir, and beat him will •… into his grave, or back to the Priest, and be unwaddded agony, for I wonot bee baund to leg with him and live with him the life of an honest woman for awe the layves good i'Loncoshire.

Dou.
An honest woman: that's a good mind Parnel What say you to this Lawrence?

Law.
Keep her of o'me, and I shan teln •…eou, and she be by I am no body: But keep her off and search me, let me be searched as never witch was searched, and find any thing more or lass upon me than a sufficient mon should have, and let me be honest by it.

Art.
Do you hear this Parnell?

Par.
Ah leer, leer, deal tack the leer, troist ye and hong ye.

Dou.
Alas it is too plain, the poor fellow is bewitched.
Here is a plain Maleficium versus hanc now.
Are.
And so is she bewitched too into this immodesty.

Ban.
She would never talk so else

Law.
I prayn yeow give me the lere o'that Latin sir.

Dough.
The meaning is, you must get half a dozen bastards Within this twelvemoneth, and that will mend your next ma∣riage.

Law.
And I thought it would ma' Parnel, love me i'd be sure on it, and gang about it now right.

Sha.
You're soon provided it seems for such a journey.

Dou
Best tarry till thy head be whole Lawrence.

Pa.
Nay, nay, ay's white cast away ent I be unwedded agent
And then in undertack to find 3 better husbands in a bean cod.
Sha.

Bant.

Exeunt



ACTVS, V. SCENA, I.
Enter Doughty, Miller, Boy in a C•…p▪
Doughty▪
THou art a brave Boy, the honour of thy Coun try; thy Statue shall be set up in brass upon the Market Cross in Lancaster, I bless the time that I answered at the 〈◊◊〉 thee: •…oaks did I ever thin•… that a Godson of mine should have fought hand to fist with the Devil!

Mil.
He was ever an unhappy Boy Sir, and like enough to grow acquainted with him; and friends may fall out sometimes.

Dought.
Thou art a dogged Sire, and doestnot know the virtue of my Godson, my son now; he shall be thy son no longer: he and I will worry all the Witches in Lance∣shire.

Mil.
You were best take heed though.

Dough.
I care not, though we leave not above three untain∣ted women in the Parish, we'll doe it.

Mil.
Doe what you please Sir, there's the Boy stout enough to justify any thing he has said. Now it is out, he should be my Son still by that: Though he was at Death's 〈◊〉 before he would reveal any thing, 〈◊〉 •…noble jades had so threatened him, and as soon as ever he had told he men•…ed.

Dought.
It is well he did so, we will so swing them in two∣penny halters Boy.

Mil.
For my part I have no reason to hinder any thing that may root them all out; I have tasted enough of their mischief, witness my usage in th Mill, which could be nothing but their Roguery. One night in my sleep they set me a stride stark na∣ked a top of my Mill, a bitter cold night too; it was day light be∣fore I w ached, and I durst never speak of it to this hour, because I thought it impossible to be believed.




Dought.
Villainous H•…gs

Mil.
And all last Summer, my Wise could not make a bit of butter.

Dough.
It would not come, 〈◊〉 it?

Mill.
No Sir, we could not make it come, though she and I both together, churned almost our 〈◊〉 out, and nothing would come, but all ran into thin waterish gear: the Pigs would not drink 〈◊〉.

Dought.
Is it possible

Mil.
None but one, and he ran out of his wits upon it, till we bound his head, and laid him a sleep, but he has had a wry mouth ever since.

Dought.
That the Devil should put in their hearts to delight in such Villainies! I have sought 〈◊〉 these two days, and he•… of a 〈◊◊◊◊〉, though none more∣tall, but could not find whom to mistrust for a Witch till now this boy, this happy boy informs me.

And they should near have been sought for me if their af∣frightments and dive•… devices, had not brought my Boy in∣to such a sickness; Whereupon indeed I thought good to ac∣quaint your worship, and bring the Boy unto you being his Godfather, and as you now stick not to say his Father.

Dought.
After you I thank yo•… Gossip. But my Boy thou ha•… 〈◊〉 fied me in their names, and thy knowledge of the wo∣men, their turning into shapes, their dog-trickes, and their horse tricks, and their great Feast in the Barn (a pox take them with my Sirloin, I say still.) But a little more of thy combat with the Devil, I prithee; he came to thee like a Boy thou say∣est, about thine own bigness?

Boy.
Yes Sir, and he asked me where I dwelt, and what my name was.

Dough.
Ah Rogue!

Boy.
But it was in a quarrelsome way; Whereupon I was as stout, and asked him who made him an examiner?

Dough.
Ah good Boy.

Mil.
In that he was my Son.

Boy.
He told me he would know or beat it out of me,
And I told him he should not, and bid him doe his worst;
And to it we went.


Dough.
In that he was my son again, ha boy; I see him at it now.

Boy.
We fought a quarter of an hour, till his sharpe nails made my ears bleed.

Dough.
O the grand Devil pare 'em.

Boy.
I wondered to find him so strong in my hands, see∣ming but of mine own age and bigness, till I looking down, perceived he had clubbed cloven feet like Ox feet; but his face was as young as mine.

Dought.
A pox, but by his feet, he may be the Club-footed Horse-coursers father, for all his young looks.

Boy.
But I was afraid of his feet, and ran from him towards a light that I saw, and when I came to it, it was one of the Wit∣ches in white upon a Bridge, that scared me back again, and then met me the Boy again, and he struck me and laid me for dead.

Mil.
Till I wondering at his stay, went out and found him in the Trance; since which time, he has been haunted and frigh∣ted with Goblins, 40. times, and never durst tell any thing (as I said) because the Hags had so threatened him till in his sickness he revealed it to his mother.

Dough.
And she told no body but folks on it. Well Gossip Gritty, as thou art a Miller, and a close thief, now let us keep it as close as we may till we take 'hem, and see them handsome∣lie hanged of the way: Ha my little Cu••e-divell, thou art a made man. Come, away with me.

Exeunt.
Enter Soldier.
Sold.
These two nights I have slept well and heard no noise
Of Cats, or Rats; most sure the fellow dreamed,
And scratched himself in 's sleep. I have traveld' Deserts,
Beheld Wolves, Bears, and Lyons: Indeed what not?
Of horrid shape; And shall I be afraid
Of Cats in mine own Country? I can never
Grow so Mouse-hearted. It is now a Calm
And no wind stirring, I can bear no sail;



Then best lye down to sleep. Nay rest by me
Good Morglay, my Comrague and Bedfellow
That never failed me yet; I know thou did not.
If I be waked, see thou be stirring too;
Then come a Gibe as big as Ascapart
VVe'l make him play at Leap-frog. A brave Soldiers lodging,
The floor my Bed, a Millstone for my Pillow,
The Sails for Curtains. So good night.
Lies down.
Enter Mrs. Generous, Mall, all the VVitches and their Spirits (at several doors.)
Mrs.
Is Nab come?

Mal.
Yes.

Mrs.
Whore's Jug?

Mal.
On horseback yet,
Now lighting from her Broome-staffe.
Mrs.
But whore's Peg?

Mal.
Entered the Mill already.

Mrs.
Is he fast?

Mal.
As senseless as a Dormouse.

Mrs.
Then to work, to work my pretty Laplands
Pinch, here, scratch,
Doe that within, without we will keep the watch.
The Witches retired: the Spirits come about him with a dreadful noise: he starts.
Sold.
Am I in Hell, then have amongst you devils;
This side, and that side, what behind, before?
Isle keep my face unscratch'd despite you all:
What, doe you pinch in private, claws I feel
But can see nothing, nothing pinch me thus?
Have at you then, I and have at you still;
And still have at you.
Beats them off, follows them in, and Enters again.
One of them I have paid
In leaping out of the hole a foot or ear
Or something I have light on. What all gone?
All quiet? not a Cat that's heard to mew?
Nay then Isle try to take another nap,


Though I sleep with mine eyes open.
Exit.
Enter Mr. Generous, and Robin.
Gen.
Robin, the last night that I lodged at home
My Wife (if thou remember) lay abroad,
But no words of that.
Rob.
You have taught me silence.

Gen.
I rose thus early much before my hour,
To take her in her bed▪ It is yet not five:
The Sun scarce up. Those horses take and lead'em
Into the Stable, see them rubbed and dressed,
We have rid hard. Now in the interim I
Will step and see how my new Miller fares,
Or whether he slept better in his charge,
Than those which did precede him.
Rob.
Sir I shall.

Gen.
But one thing more—

Whispers.
Enter Arthur.
Arth.
Now from the last nights witchcraft we are freed,
And I that had not power to clear my self
From base aspersion, am at liberty
For thow'd revenge: I cannot be at peace
(The night-spell being took of) till I have met
With noble Mr. Generous: in whose search
The best part of this morning I have spent,
His wife now I suspect.
Rob.
By your leave Sir.

Arth.
O you're well met, pray tell me how long is it
Since you were first my Father?
Rob
Be patient I beseech you, what doe you mean Sir?

Arth.
But that I honour
Thy Master, to whose goodness I am bound,
And still must remain thankful, I should prove
VVorse than a Murderer, a mere Parricide



By killing thee my Father.
Rob.
I your Father? he was a man I always loved
And honoured. He bred me.
Arth.
And you begot me? oh you used me finely last night?

Gen.
Pray what's the matter Sir?

Arth.
My worthy friend, but that I honour you
As one to whom I am so much obligd,
This Villain could not stir a foot from hence
Till perished by my sword.
Goner.
How hath he wronged you?
Be of a milder temper I entreat,
Relate what and when done?
Arth.
You may command me,
If ask me what wrongs, know this Groom pretends
He hath strumpe•… my mother, if when, blazed
Last night at midnight. If you ask me further
Where, in your own house; when he pointed to me
As had I been his Bastard.
Rob.
I doe this? I am a horse again if I got you, Master, why Master.

Gen.
I know you Mr. Arthur, for a Gentleman
Of fair endowments, a most solid brain,
And settled understanding. Why this fellow
These two days was scarce sundried from my side,
And for the last night I am most assured
He slept within my Chamber, 12. miles off,
We have ne'er parted since.
Arth,
You tell me wonders.
Since all your words to me are Oracles,
And such as I most constantly believe.
But Sir, shall I be bold and plain withal,
I am suspicious ell's not well at home;
I dare proceed no farther without leave,
Yet there is something lodged within my breast
Which I am loath to utter.
Gen.
Keep it there,
I pray doe a season (O my fears)


VVhet.
In my Uncles absence who but I should comfort my Aunt,
Am I not of the Blood, am not I next of Kin?
Why Aunt?
Mrs. Gen
Good Nephew leave me.

VVhet.
The Devil shall leave you ere isle forsake you, Aunt, you know, •…ic is So, and being so sick doe you think isle leave you, what know I but this Bed may prove your death-bed, and and then I hope you will remember me, that is, remember me in your Will.

(Knock within.)
Who's that knocks with such authority. Ten to one my Uncles come to town.

Mrs. Gen.
If it be so, excuse my weakness to him, say I can speak with none.

Mal.
I will, and escape him if I can; by this accident all must come out, and here's no stay for me

(Knock again)
Again, stay you here with your Aunt, and isle go let in your Uncle.

VVhet.
Doe good Mal, and how, and how sweet Aunt?

Enter Mr. Goner. Mal, Arthur, Soldier, and Robin.
Gen.
You're well met here, I am told you oft frequent
This house as my Wives choice companion,
Yet have I seldom seen you.
Mal.
Pray, by your leave Sir,
Your wife is taken with a sudden qualm
She hath sent me for a Doctor.
Gen.
But that labour isle save you, Soldier take her to your charge.
And now whore's this sick woman.
VVhet.
O Uncle you come in good time, my Aunt is so sud∣dainly taken as if she were ready to give up the spirit.

Gen.
It is almost time she did, speak how is it wife
My Nephew tells me you were took last night
With a shrewd sickness, which this Maid confirms.
Mrs.
Yes sir, but now desire no company.
Noise troubles me, and I would gladly sleep.
Goner.
In company there's comfort, prithee wife
Lend me thy hand, and let me feel thy pulse,
Perhaps some Fever, by their beating I



May guess at thy disease.
Mrs. Gen.
My hand, it is there.

Gen.
A dangerous sickness, and I fear t death,
It is odds you will not escape it. Take that back
And let me prove the t'other, if perhaps
I there can find more comfort.
Mrs. Gen.
I pray excuse me.

Goner.
I must not be denied,
Sick folks are peevish, and must be ore-rul'd, and so shall you.
Mrs. Gen.
Alas I have not strength to lift it up.

Goner.
If not thy hand Wife, show me but thy wrist,
And see how this will match it, here's a Testate
That cannot be out-fac'd.
Mrs. Goner.
I am undone.

VVhet.
Hath my Aunt bin playing at handee dandee, nay then if the game go this way I fear she'll have the worst hand on it.

Arth.
It is now apparent
How all the last nights business came about,
In this my late suspicion, is confirmed.
Gen.
My heart hath bled more for thy cursed relapse
Than drops hath issued from thy wounded arm.
But wherefore should I preach to one past hope?
Or where the devil himself claims right in all,
Seek the least part or interest? Leave your Bed,
Up, make you ready; I must deliver you
Into the hand of Justice. O dear friend
It is in vain to guess at this my grief
It is so inundant. Soldier take away that young
But old in mischief.
And being of these Apostat's rid so well,
Isle see my house no more be made a Hell.
Away with them
Exeunt.
Enter Bantam, and Shakston.
Ban.
Isle out of the Country, and as soon live in Lapland as Lancashire hereafter.

Shake.
What for a false illusive apparition? I hope the devil is not able to persuade thee thou art a Bastard.

Bant
No, but I am afflicted to think that the devil should have power to put such a trick upon us, to countenance a Rascal, that is one.

Shake
J hope Arthur has taken a course with his Vnclc about him by this time, who would have thought such a fool as he could have been a Witch?

Bant.
Why doe you think there's any wise folks of the qua∣lity; Can any but fools be drawn into a Covenant with the greatest enemy of mankind? yet J cannot think that VVhet∣stone is the Witch? The young Queen that was at the Wed∣ding was in the house ye know.

Enter Lawrence and Parnell, in their first Habits.
Shake.
See Lawrence and Parnell civilly accorded again it seems, and accoutred as they were wont to be when they had their wits.

Enter Seely, Join, Gregory and Win.
Greg.
Sir, if a contrite heart struck through with sense
Of it's sharpe errors, bleeding with remorse
The black polluted stain it had conceived
Of foul unnatural disobedience
May yet by your fair mercy find Remission;
You shall upraise a Son out of the gulf
Of horror and despair, unto a bliss
That shall for ever crown your goodness, and


Instructive in my after life to serve you,
In all the duties that be fit a son.
Seel.
Enough, enough, good boy, it is most apparent
We all have had our •…rrors, and as plainly
It now appears, our judgments, yea our reason
Was poisoned by some violent infection,
Quite contrary to Nature.
Bant.
This sounds well.

Seely.
I fear it was by Witchcraft: for I now
(Blessed be the power that wrought the happy means
Of my delivery) remember that
Some 3. months since I crossed a way ward woman
(One that I now suspect) for bearing with
A most unseemly disobedience,
In an untoward ill-bred son of hers,
When with an ill look and an hollow voice
She muttered out these words. Perhaps erelong
Thy self shalt be obedient to thy son.
She has played her prank it seems.
Greg.
Sir I have heard, that Witches apprehended under hands of lawful authority, doe loose their power; And all their spells are instantly dissolved.

Seel.
If it be so, then at this happy hour,
The Witch is tan that over us had power.
Joane.
Enough Child, thou art mine and all is well.

Win.
Long may you live the well-spring of my bliss,
And may my duty and my fruitful Prayers,
Draw a perpetual stream of blessings from you.
Seely.
Gentlemen welcome to my best friends house,
You know the unhappy cause that drew me hither.
Bant.
And cannot but rejoice to see the remedy so no•…e at •…and.

Enter Doughty, Miller, and boy.
Dought.
Come Gossip, come Boy—Gentlemen you are come to the bravest discovery—Mr. Seely and the rest, how is it with you? you look reasonable well me thinks.




Seely.
Sir, we doe find that we have reason enough to thank you for your Neighbourly and pious care of us.

Doughty.
Is all so well with you already? go to, will you know a reason for it Gentlemen: I have caught a whole Kennel of Witches. It seems their Witch is one of 'hem, and so they are discharm'd, they are all in Officers hands, and they will touch here with two or three of them for a little private parley, be∣fore they go to the Justices. Master Generous is coming hi∣there too, with a supply that you dream not of, and your No∣phew Arthur.

Bant.
You are beholden Sir to Master Generous in behalf of your Nephew for saving his land from forfeiture in time of your distraction.

Seely.
I will acknowledge it most thankfully.

Shake.
See he comes.

Enter Mr. Generous, Mrs. Generous, Arthur, Where∣stone, Mal, Soldier, and Robin.
Seel.
O Mr. Generous, the noble favour you have showed
My Nephew for ever binds me to you.
Goner.
I pitied then your misery, and now
Have nothing left but to bewail mine own
In this unhappy woman.
Seel.
Good Mistress Generous—

Arth.
Make a full stop there Sir, sides, sides, make sides, You know her not as I doe, stand aloof there Mistress with your darling Witch, your Nephew too if you please, because though he be no witch, he is a wel-willer to the infernal science.

Goner.
I utterly discard him in her blood
And all the good that I intended him
I will confer upon this virtuous Gentleman.
Whet.
Well Sir, though you be no Uncle, yet mine Aunt's mine Aunt, and shall be to her dying day.

Doug.
And that will be about a day after next Sizes I take it,

Enter Witches, Constable, and Officers.

Maud.
Come my sweet Puckling.

Peg.
My Mamilion.

Arth.
What doe they say?

Bant.
They call their Spirits I think.

Dought.
Now a shame take you for a farthel offooles, have you known so many of the Devils tricks, and can be ignorant of that common feat of the old Juggler; that is, to leave you all to the Law, when you are once seized on by the talons of Au∣thority? Isle undertake this little Demigorgon Constable with these Common-wealth Characters upon his staff here, is able inspire of all your bugs-words, to stave off the grand Devil for doing any of you good till you come to his Kingdom to him, and there take what you can find.

Arth.
But Gentlemen, shall we try if we can by examination get from them something that may abbreviate the cause unto the wiser in Commission for the peace before wee carry them before 'em.

Gen. & Seel.
Let it be so.

Dought.
Well say, stand out Boy, stand out Miller, stand out Robin, stand out Soldier, and lay your accusation upon 'em.

Bant.
Speak Boy doe you know•… these Creatures, women I dare not call 'em?

Boy.
Yes Sir, and saw them all in the Barn together, and ma∣ny more at their Feast and Witchery.

Rob.
And so did I, by a Devilish token, I was rid thither, though I rid home again as fast without switch or spur.

Mill.
I was ill handled by them in the Mill.

Sold.
And I sliced off a Cats foot there, that is since a hand, who ever wants it.

Seel.

Lower.
And how I were betwitched my Pall. here knows.

Porn.
Yie Loll, and the Witch I know, an I prayen yeou go

Bant.
Hold Parnell.

Porn.
Yeou can blame no honest woman, I trow, to scrat for the thing she leoves.

Mal.
Ha, ha, ha.

Dough.
Doe you laugh Gentlewoman? what say you to all these matters?

Mrs. Gen.
I will say nothing, but what you know you know,
And as the law shall find me let it take me.
Gel.
And so say I.

Mewed.
And I.

Mal.
And I, other confession you get none from us.

Arth.
What say you Granny?

Peg.
Mamilion, ho Mamilion, Mamilion.

Arth.
Who's that you call?

Peg.
My friend, my Sweet-heart, my Mamilion.

Witches.
You are not mad?

Dought.
Ah ha, that's her Devil, her Incubus I warrant; take her off from the rest they'll hurt her. Come hither poor old woman. Isle dandle a Witch a little, thou wilt speak, and tell the truth, and shalt have favour doubt not. Say art not thou a Witch?

They storm.
Peg.
It is folly to dissemble yie sir, I am one.

Dought.
And that Mamilion which thou call upon
Is thy familiar Devil is it not? Nay prithee speak.
Peg.
Yes Sir.

Dough.
That's a good woman, how long hast had's acquain∣tance, ha?

Peg.
A matter of six years Sir.

Dought.
A pretty matter. What was he like a man?

Peg.
Yes when I pleased.

Dought.
And then he lay with thee, did he not sometimes?

Peg.
It is folly to dissemble; twice a Week he never failed me.

Dough.
Humh—and how? and how a little? was he a good Bedfellow?

Peg.
It is folly to speak worse of him than he is.

Dough.
I trust me is it. Give the Devil his due.

Peg.
He pleased me well Sir, like a proper man.

Dought.
There was sweet coupling.

Peg.
Only his flesh felt cold.



Arth.
He wanted his great fires about him that he has at home.

Dough.
Peace, and did he wear good clothes?

Peg.
Gentleman like, but black black points and all.

Dought.
I, very like his points were black enough. But come we will trifle w'yee no longer. Now shall you all to the Justices, and let them take order with you till the Sizes, and then let Law take his course, and Uivat Rex. Mr. Generous I am sorry for your cause of sorrow, we shall not have your company?

Goner.
No sir, my Prayers for her souls recovery.
Shall not be wanting to her, but mine eyes
Must never see her more.
Rob.
Mal, adieu sweet Mal, ride your next journey with the company you have there.

Mal.
Well Rogue I may live to ride in a Coach before I come to the Gallows yet.

Rob.
And Mrs. the horse that stays for you rides better with a Halter than your jingling bridle.

Exeunt Gen. & Robin.
Dought.
Mr. Seely I rejoice for your families atonement.

Seel.
And I praise heaven for you that were the means to it.

Dough.
On before Drovers with your untoward Cattle.

Bant.
You're a kind Kinsman.

Exeunt.
Flourish.
    FINIS.



Song. II. Act.

1
Come Mousy, come Puckling,
And come my sweet Suckling,
My pretty Mamillion, my Joy,
Fall each to his Duggy,
While kindly we buggie,
As tender as Nurse over Boy.
Then suck our bloods freely, and with it be jolly,
While merrily we sing, hey Trolly Lolly.

2
We will dandle and clip ye,
We will stroke ye, and le•…pe ye,
And all that we have is your due;
The feats you doe for us,
And those which you store us
Withal, ties us only to you.
Then suck our blo•…ds freely, and with it be jolly,
While merrily we sing, hey Trolly Lolly.


THE EPILOGVE.
NOw while the Witches must expect their due
By lawful Justice, we appeal to you
For favourable censure; what their crime
May bring upon'em, ripens yet of time
Has not revealed. Perhaps great Mercy may
After just con•…mnation give them day
Of longer life. We represent as much
As they have done, before Laws hand did touch
Upon their guilt; But dare not hold it fit,
That we for Justices and Judges sit.
And personate their grave wisdoms on the Stage
Whom we are bound to honour; No, the Age
Allows it not. Therefore unto the Laws
We can but bring the Witches and their cause,
And there wwould leave'em, as their Devils did,
Should we go further with'em? Wit forbid;
What of their story, further shall ensue,
We must refer to time, our selves to you.
